From The Matrix<br>
(Phone)<br>
The One: I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid. You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you, a world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries, a world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.

From The Matrix<br>
(Nebuchadnezzar)<br>
Trinity: Neo.<br>
Tank: What just happened?<br>
Trinity: An agent. You have to send me back.<br>
Tank: I can't.<br>

(Subway station)<br>
Agent Smith: Mr. Anderson.<br>

(Nebuchadnezzar)<br>
Trinity: Run, Neo. Run! What is he doing?<br>
Morpheus: He's beginning to believe.<br>

(Subway station)<br>
Agent Smith: Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson? That is the sound of inevitability. That is the sound of your death. Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.<br>
Neo: My name is Neo.

From The Matrix<br>
(Rooftop)<br>
Morpheus: Do you believe it now, Trinity?<br>
Neo: Morpheus. The Oracle, she told me I'm...<br>
Morpheus: She told you exactly what you needed to hear, that's all. Neo, sooner or later you're going to realize, just as I did, there's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
	</p>

From The Matrix<br>
Neo: Stop. I don't believe this is happening.<br>
Tank: Neo, this has to be done.<br>
Neo: Does it? I don't know, I... this can't be just coincidence. It can't be.<br>
Tank: What are you talking about?<br>
Neo: The Oracle. She told me this would happen. She told me that I would have to make a choice.<br>
Trinity: What choice?... What are you doing?<br>
Neo: I'm going in.<br>
Trinity: No you're not.<br>
Neo: I have to.<br>
Trinity: Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself so that he could get you out. There's no way that you're going back in.<br>
Neo: Morpheus did what he did because he believed I am something I'm not.<br>
Trinity: What?<br>
Neo: I'm not the one, Trinity. The Oracle hit me with that too.<br>
Trinity: No. You have to be.<br>
Neo: Sorry, I'm not. I'm just another guy.<br>
Trinity: No, Neo. That's not true. It can't be true.<br>
Neo: Why?<br>
Tank: Neo, this is loco. They've got Morpheus in a military controlled building. Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him. Three of them. I want Morpheus back too, but what you're talking about is suicide.<br>
Neo: I know that's what it looks like, but it's not. I can't explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed. I understand that now. But that's why I have to go.<br>
Tank: Why?<br>
Neo: Because I believe in something.<br>
Trinity: What?<br>
Neo: I believe I can bring him back.<br>

From The Matrix<br>
Oracle: I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway. And don't worry about the vase.<br>
Neo: What vase?<br>
Oracle: That vase.<br>
Neo: I'm sorry.<br>
Oracle: I said don't worry about it. I'll get one of my students to fix it.<br>
Neo: How did you know?<br>
Oracle: What's really going to bake your noodle later on is, would you still have broken it if I hadn't said anything? You're cuter than I expected. No wonder she likes you.<br>
Neo: Who?<br>
Oracle: Not too bright, though. You know why Morpheus brought you to see me?<br>
Neo: I think so.<br>
Oracle: So, what do you think? You think you're the one?<br>
Neo: I don't know.<br>
Oracle: You know what that means? It's Latin. Means `Know thyself'. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Being the one is just like being in love. No one can tell you your in love, you just know it. Through and through. Balls to bones. Well, I better have a look at you. Open your mouth, say Ahhh.<br>
Neo: Ahhh.<br>
Oracle: Okay. Now I'm supposed to say, `Umm, that's interesting, but...' then you say...<br>
Neo: But what?<br>
Oracle: But you already know what I'm going to tell you.<br>
Neo: I'm not the one.<br>
Oracle: Sorry kiddo. You got the gift, but it looks like you're waiting for something.<br>
Neo: What?<br>
Oracle: Your next life maybe, who knows? That's the way these things go. What's funny?<br>
Neo: Morpheus. He...he almost had me convinced.
Oracle: I know. Poor Morpheus. Without him we're lost.<br>
Neo: What do you mean, without him?<br>
Oracle: Are you sure you want to hear this? Morpheus believes in you, Neo. And no one, not you, not even me can convince him otherwise. He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.<br>
Neo: What?<br>
Oracle: You're going to have to make a choice. In the one hand you'll have Morpheus' life and in the other hand you'll have your own. One of you is going to die. Which one will be up to you. I'm sorry, kiddo, I really am. You have a good soul, and I hate giving good people bad news. Oh, don't worry about it. As soon as you step outside that door, you'll start feeling better. You'll remember you don't believe in any of this fate crap. You're in control of your own life, remember? Here, take a cookie. I promise, by the time you're done eating it, you'll feel right as rain.<br>
Morpheus: What was said was for you and for you alone.

From The Matrix<br>
Spoon boy: Do not try and bend the spoon. That's impossible. Instead only try to realize the truth.<br>
Neo: What truth?<br>
Spoon boy: There is no spoon.<br>
Neo: There is no spoon?<br>
Spoon boy: Then you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.
	</p>

From The Matrix<br>
Morpheus: The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around. What do you see? Business men, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it. Were you listening to me Neo, or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?<br>
Morpheus: Sentient programs. They can move in and out of any software still hard wired to their system. That means that anyone we haven't unplugged is potentially an agent. Inside the Matrix, they are everyone and they are no one. We are survived by hiding from them, by running from them. But they are the gatekeepers. They are guarding all the doors. They are holding all the keys, which means that sooner or later, someone is going to have to fight them.<br>
Neo: Someone?<br>
Morpheus: I won't lie to you, Neo. Every single man or woman who has stood their ground, everyone who has fought an agent has died. But where they have failed, you will succeed.

From The Matrix<br>
Mouse: Morpheus is fighting Neo.<br>
Morpheus: How did I beat you?<br>
Neo: You're too fast.<br>
Morpheus: Do you believe that my being stronger or faster has anything to do with my muscles in this place? You think that's air you're breathing now?... Again.<br>
Morpheus: What are you waiting for? You're faster than this. Don't think you are, know you are.... Come on. Stop trying to hit me and hit me.<br>
Mouse: I don't believe it.<br>
Neo: I know what you're trying to do.<br>
Morpheus: I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but I can only show you the door, you're the one that has to walk through it. Tank, load the jump program.... You have to let it all go, Neo, fear, doubt, and disbelief. Free your mind.
	</p>

	<p id="8">
From The Matrix<br>
Neo: I can't go back, can I?<br>
Morpheus: No. But if you could, would you really want to? I feel I owe you an apology. We have a rule. We never free a mind once it's reached a certain age. It's dangerous, the mind has trouble letting go. I've seen it before and I'm sorry. I did what I did because...I had to. When the Matrix was first built, there was a man born inside who had the ability to change whatever he wanted, to remake the Matrix as he saw fit. It was he who freed the first of us, taught us the truth. As long as the Matrix exists the human race will never be free. After he died the Oracle prophesied his return and that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix and the war, bring freedom to our people. That is why there are those of us who have spent our entire lives searching the Matrix looking for him. I did what I did because I believe that search is over.... Get some rest, you're going to need it.<br>
Neo: For what?<br>
Morpheus: Your training.

	<p id="7">
From The Matrix<br>
Neo: This...this isn't real?<br>
Morpheus: What is real? How do you define real? If youâ€™re talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. This is the world that you know. The world as it was at the end of the twentieth century. It exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation that we call the Matrix. You've been living in a dream world, Neo. This is the world as it exists today.... Welcome to the Desert of the Real. We have only bits and pieces of information but what we know for certain is that at some point in the early twenty-first century all of mankind was united in celebration. We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to AI.<br>
Neo: AI? You mean artificial intelligence?<br>
Morpheus: A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. We don't know who struck first, us or them. But we know that it was us that scorched the sky. At the time they were dependent on solar power and it was believed that they would be unable to survive without an energy source as abundant as the sun. Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate it seems is not without a sense of irony. The human body generates more bio-electricity than a 120-volt battery and over 25,000 BTU's of body heat. Combined with a form of fusion the machines have found all the energy they would ever need. There are fields, endless fields, where human beings are no longer born, we are grown. For the longest time I wouldn't believe it, and then I saw the fields with my own eyes. Watch them liquefy the dead so they could be fed intravenously to the living. And standing there, facing the pure horrifying precision, I came to realize the obviousness of the truth. What is the Matrix? Control. The Matrix is a computer generated dream world built to keep us under control in order to change a human being into this.<br>
Neo: No. I don't believe it. It's not possible.<br>
Morpheus: I didn't say it would be easy, Neo. I just said it would be the truth.<br>
Neo: Stop. Let me out. Let me out. I want out.

From The Matrix<br>
Morpheus: Welcome to the real world. We've done it, Trinity. We've found him.<br>
Trinity: I hope you're right.<br>
Morpheus: I don't have to hope. I know it.<br>
Neo: Am I dead?<br>
Morpheus: Far from it.		
	</p>

	<p id="5">
From The Matrix<br>
Morpheus: At last. Welcome, Neo. As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.<br>
Neo: It's an honor to meet you.<br>
Morpheus: No, the honor is mine. Please, come. Sit down. I imagine that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole? Hm?<br>
Neo: You could say that.<br>
Morpheus: I can see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up. Ironically, this is not far from the truth. Do you believe in fate, Neo?<br>
Neo: No.<br>
Morpheus: Why not?<br>
Neo: Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.<br>
Morpheus: I know exactly what you mean. Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you know you can't explain. But you feel it. You've felt it your entire life. That there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is but it's there, like a splinter in your mind driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about?<br>
Neo: The Matrix?<br>
Morpheus: Do you want to know what IT is? The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us, even now in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.<br>
Neo: What truth?<br>
Morpheus: That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage, born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your mind.... Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. This is your last chance. After this there is no turning back. You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.... Remember, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.

From The Matrix<br>
Switch: Stop the car. Listen to me, Copper-top. We don't have time for twenty questions. Right now there's only one rule, our way or the highway.<br>
Neo: Fine.<br>
Trinity: Please, Neo. You have to trust me.<br>
Neo: Why?<br>
Trinity: Because you have been down there, Neo. You know that road. You know exactly where it ends. And I know that's not where you want to be.

From The Matrix<br>
(Interrogation)<br>
Agent Smith: As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson. It seems that you've been living two lives. In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company, you have a social security number, you pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias Neo and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not. I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson. You're here because we need your help. We know that you've been contacted by a certain individual, a man who calls himself Morpheus. Now whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant. He is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive. My colleagues believe that I am wasting my time with you but I believe that you wish to do the right thing. We're willing to wipe the slate clean, give you a fresh start and all that we're asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.<br>
Neo: Yeah. Wow, that sound like a really good deal. But I think I got a better one. How about I give you the finger... and you give me my phone call.		
	</p>

	<p id="2">
From The Matrix<br>
(Office)<br>
Mr. Rhineheart: You have a problem with authority, Mr. Anderson. You believe that you are special, that somehow the rules do not apply to you. Obviously you are mistaken. This company is one of the top software companies in the world because every single employee understands that they are part of a whole. Thus if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem. The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson. Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forward or you choose to find yourself another job. Do I make myself clear?<br>
Neo: Yes, Mr. Rhineheart, perfectly clear.		
	</p>

From The Matrix<br>
Trinity: Please just listen. I know why you're here, Neo. I know what you've been doing. I know why you hardly sleep, why you live alone, and why night after night you sit at your computer. You're looking for him. I know, because I was once looking for the same thing. And when he found me, he told me I wasn't really looking for him. I was looking for an answer. It's the question that drives us mad. It's the question that brought you here. You know the question just as I did.<br>
Neo: What is the Matrix?<br>
Trinity: The answer is out there, Neo. It's looking for you. And it will find you, if you want it to.
