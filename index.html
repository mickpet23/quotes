From Long Bright River by Liz Moore<br>
I think of the many honorable people who work for the organization. Truman was in the PPD. Mike Dipaolo still is. Davis Nguyen. Gloria Peters. Even Denise Chambers, who recently phone me personally to apologize.<br>
Then there are the Laffertys, the evil ones. They're few and far between, but everybody's met one.<br>
The hardest cases, I think--perhaps the most dangerous ones--are the friends of the Laffertys'. People like Sergeant Aheard, who has possibly known for years about what goes on in Kensington. Maybe he even participates himself--who knows. And he'll never be fired, never be questioned, never even be disciplined. He'll go on with his daily routine, showing up for work, casually abusing his power in ways that will have lasting effects on individuals and communities, on the whole city of Philadelphia, for years.<br>
It's the Ahearns of the world who scare me.<br>
I still don't have a job. I probably could have gotten a lawyer and sued the PPD, given all that happened, but I don't have the inclination.<br>
Instead, I live on unemployment. I work at my uncle Rich's car dealership in Frankford, doing paperwork and answering phones, being paid under the table, all cash. With a more regular schedule, I have found a regular babysitter, someone I trust, to watch Thomas two days a week now. Mondays and Wednesdays, I bring Thomas with me to Rich's. And Fridays, Mrs. Mahon watches him.<br>
The system isn't perfect, but it's working for now. Next year, Thomas will go to kindergarten, and everything will change again. Maybe I'll sign up for classes at the community college. Maybe, eventually, I'll get a degree. Be a history teacher, like Ms. Powell. Maybe.<br>
When I get it, I tell myself, I'll frame it, and then send a copy to Gee.

From Long Bright River by Liz Moore<br>
When I think about Kacey, when I wonder whether she will find the strength and luck and perseverance to get and stay clean, it is these souls I think of first. How few ever seem to make it out. I think of the Piper, the whole town of Hamelin, shocked in his wake, abandoned and condemned.<br>
But then I look at Kacey--who comes to visit most Sundays now, who at this moment is sitting on my couch, who on this day has 189 days clean--and think, maybe she'll be one of the few. The veteran of some war, wounded but alive. Maybe Kacey will outlive us all, will live to be a hundred and five. Maybe Kacey will be all right.<br>
Letting hope back in feels right and wrong all at once. Like letting Thomas sleep in my bed when he really should sleep in his.<br>
Like letting him meet the woman who brought him into the world.<br>
Like breaking an oath of loyalty when you know a secret needs telling.

From Long Bright River by Liz Moore<br>
Kacey looks at me for a long time, searching my face.<br>
Then she looks past me, toward the corner, toward Alonzo's store. She's frozen. I turn, finally, to see what she sess, but no one is there. And I know, without asking, that Kacey is picturing Paula Mulroney standing there, one leg propped up against the wall, cocky, smiling, her usual stance.<br>
--They were my friends, says kacey, quietly now. All of them. Even the ones I didn't know.<br>
--I'm sorry, I say at last.<br>
She doesn't reply.<br>
--Kacey, I'm sorry, I say again.<br>
But the El train is going by now, and I don't know if my sister can hear me.

From Long Bright River by Liz Moore<br>
--I told you, says Kacey. I knew when he found out that Eddie Lafferty might be the one killing those women, he wouldn't stand for it. I know him.<br>
I shake my head. I notice, suddenly, that Kacey looks unsteady and pale. She has her hands on her stomach. She is six months pregnant, now, and seems to feel it. I don't know if she'll make it the whole way. She keeps insisting she's fine, but she's bent forward slightly. How long has it been, I wonder, since her last dose of methadone?<br>
--Are you okay? I ask her.<br>
--Fine, Kacey says, tightly.<br>
We walk in silence a little longer. Then she goes on.<br>
--Connor can do bad things, Kacey says, but he's not all bad. Almost nobody is.<br>
I have nothing to say to this. I picture Mrs. Mahon, her hand tipping back and forth in the air above the chessboard. They're bad and good both, all the pieces. It is possible to acknowledge, on some level, the truth of this. And yet I hate Connor McClatchie for what he did to my sister. And I know, without a doubt, that I'll never forgive him.

From The Walking Dead<br>
Michonne: Carl sleep okay?<br>
Rick: Yeah, first time in a while. Thanks for watching him while I kept watch last night. He's not sleeping much as it is--but alone in the tent, it's near impossible.<br>
Michonne: I'm happy to do it. Just wanted to say--you did good last night. Seemed like you were you--for the first time in a while.<br>
Rick: What do you mean? I was just doing what was right. Anyone would have done it.<br>
Michonne: But you did it. No one else. And you didn't just do what was "right" you did what you thought was right. And what you thought was right ended up being right. You saved that girl's life.<br>
Rick: Why are you telling me this?<br>
Michonne: You've been second-guessing yourself. I see how unsure you are. I see what you're doing and you need to stop it. Trust your insticts. You may be the only thing keeping us alive.<br>
Rick: Thanks, Michonne, but it's going to take a lot more than that to convince me I didnt' kill my wife.

From Two Girls Down by Louisa Luna<br>
"What was the question?" Vega said, sounding genuine.<br> 
She stomped his ribs with her heel and kept kicking.<br>  
"What was the question?" Vega said, louder. "What was the question?"<br> 
McKie screamed again and tried to turn onto his back and cover his abdomen with his bloody hand.<br> 
"Who am I, right? Right? Right?"<br> 
She held her foot right over his face, let it hover. And then she said what Perry had taught her-- someone asks who you are, you tell them the only thing they need to know:<br> 
"I'm the motherfucker who gets. Shit. Done."<br> 
Then she kicked him once more in the face, and he was out.

From V For Vendatta<br>
V(Evey): "Give me a viking funeral," you said. That isn't much. That isn't much to ask. Not after all you did. You came out of an abattoir unharmed, but not unchanged. And saw freedom's necessity; not just for you, but for us all. You saw, and seeing, dared to do. How purposeful was your vendetta, how benign, almost like surgery. Your foes assumed you sought revenge upon their flesh alone, but you did not stop there. You gored their ideology as well. The people stand within the ruins of society, a jail intended to outlive them all. The door is open. They can leave, or fall instead to squabbling and thence new slaveries. The choice is theirs, as ever it must be. I will not lead them, but I'll help them build. Help them create where I'll not help them kill. The age of killers is no more. They have no place within our better world. "Give me a viking funeral," you said. It's yours, my love... it's yours.

From V For Vendatta<br>
V(Evey): Good evening, London. I would introduce myself, but truth to tell, I do not have a name. You can call me "V." Since mankind's dawn, a handful of oppressors have accepted the responsibility over our lives that we should have accepted for ourselves. By doing so, they took our power. By doing nothing, we gave it away. We've seen where their way leads, through camps and wars, towards the slaughterhouse. In anarchy, there is another way. With anarchy, from rubble comes new life, hope reinstated. They say anarchy's dead, but see... reports of my death were exaggerated. Tomorrow, Downing Street will be destroyed, the head reduced to ruins, an end to what has gone before. Tonight, you must choose what comes next. Lives of our own, or a return to chains. Choose carefully. And so, adieu.

Dominic(policeman): They're still there. Not doing anything, mind. Just waiting. It's funny... they're not the terrorist's followers or anything. They're just rioters. But he's become some sort of all-purpose symbol to them, hasn't he?<br>
Finch(main detective): People need symbols, Dominic. He understood that, we've forgotten it. Those people outside lost families during the war. We've kept the lid on their bitterness for years, but we haven't helped them deal with it. Maybe he didn't either, but he certainly took the lid off... just like Larkhill did for me. Everything's different now, Dominic. I don't belong here anymore.<br>
Dominic: You're going? Mr. Finch, listen, it's the drugs...<br>
Finch: Susan's dead, with Creedy and Heyer dividing his carcass. They're not hallucinations. Neither was the war. I lost my family, and thought following orders could heal that. It can't. I'm following my own orders now, and getting out before everything blows, perhaps you should, too. Goodbye Dominic. Take care, lad.

From V For Vendatta<br>
V: First, you must discover whose face lies behind this mask, but you must never know my face. Is that quite clear?<br>
Evey (inner thoughts): No. No, it isn't clear at all. V, you wouldn't die and leave me in all this confusion, so you can't be dead. That's all there is to it. I'm going to walk up these stairs and through that door and you'll be alive and it will be just another mean trick, another part of my education. No hanging back. Straight up the stairs, straight through the door, and... So. Dead then. Oh christ, what happens next? You never said. You never said what you were educating me for. You never told me what I'm supposed to do. All right. All right, then, what I do is this: I walk towards the body, very quietly, very reverently... and I stoop down, my fingers struggle clumsily with elasticated straps... and then I take off the mask...No. No, that isn't what I do. What I do is, in tears I stumble over to the corpse. It's slippery with blood beneath my fingers, but I tear the mask aside, and... No. No. That's not it. Because you were so big, V, and what if you're just nobody? Or even if you're someone, you'll be smaller, cause of all the people that you could have been but weren't. Oh, I don't know. I don't know what I mean. Just do it. There's no reason why I shouldn't. No one here to stop me. I'll just walk across the floor and take hold of the mask, and... No. No, I'm past that one. You weren't my dad. I know that. Even if you were, it wouldn't be enough. If I take off that mask, something will go away forever, be diminished because whoever you are isn't as big as the idea of you, but... but... you said I had to, that I had to know... so I start walking towards the body, trying not to tread in all the blood. It doesn't move. It doesn't look much like a person anymore. Something has gone from it. I kneel, my hands are trembling, I can hardly find the fastenings, but finally I lift away that maddening smile, and... [a mask looking like Evey]... and at last I know. I know who V must be.

V: There, did you think to kill me? There's no flesh or blood within this cloak to kill. There's only an idea. Ideas are bulletproof. Farewell.

From V For Vendatta<br>
V: You asked for knowledge, Eve, and that is what I shall pass on to you. Knowledge, like air, is vital to life. Like air, no one should be denied it...I've been teaching you to breathe.<br>
Evey: Are these rooms connected?<br>
V: Everything is connected. You must understand that knowledge is not all your heritage. It includes also courage and belief, like hers that we commemorate herein... and romance. Always, always romance. Midst insurrection's clamour, we may easily forget just what it is for which we strive. Isn't it dancing? Scented shoulders? Pupils widened by desire or wine? Anarchy must embrace the din of bombs and cannon-fire... yet always must it love sweet music more...<br>
V: Unlike t.v, we cannot have too much of science, despite its nuclear quirks. With science, ideas can germinate within a bed of theory, form, and practice that assists their growth... but we, as gardeners, must beware... for some seeds are the seeds of ruin... and the most iridescent blooms are often the most dangerous.<br>
V: Anarchy wears two faces, both creator and destroyer. Thus destroyers topple empires; make a canvas of clean rubble where creators can then build a better world. Rubble, once achieved, makes further ruins means irrelevant. Away with our explosives, then! Away with our destroyers! They have no place within our better world. But let us raise a toast to all our bombers, all our bastards, most unlovely and most unforgivable. Let's drink to their health... then meet with them no more.

Finch(detective): How? How did I get here, to this stinking place: my job, my life; my conscience; my prison... the answer's there, written on the floor for me to read, but I don't understand it. And yes, it's just the drugs, but... but he was drugged too, locked away to die, and he reached some understanding. Why can't I? I look at this mad pattern, but where are the answers? Who imprisoned me here? Who keeps me here? Who can release me? Who's controlling and constraining my life, except... me? I... I'm free. Freeeee!

From V For Vendatta<br>
V: It does not do to rely too much on silent majorities, Evey, for silence is a fragile thing... One loud noise, and it's gone. But the people are so cowed and disorganized. A few might take the opportunity to protest, but it'll just be a voice crying in the wilderness. Noise is relative to the silence preceding it. The more absolute the hush, the more shocking the thunderclap. Our masters have not heard the people's voice for generations, Evey... and it is much much louder thatn they care to remember.

Evey: V? These are some things that I moved out of my room. I don't need them anymore.<br>
V: Spring cleaning, Evey? In November?<br>
Evey: No... I just felt like throwing out everything that wasn't necessary. Do you ever feel like that?<br>
V: Oh yes.

From V For Vendatta<br>
V: Welcome home.<br>
Evey: You. You did this. To me. You did this to me. You hit me and and you cut my hair. It was you. It was just you all this time. You... tortured... me. Oh, you tortured me.<br>
V: Because I love you. Because I want to set you free.<br>
Evey: Because? Set me free? Don't you realise? Do you realise what you did to me? You nearly drove me mad, V!<br>
V: If that's what it takes, Evey.<br>
Evey: I hate you. I hate you because you just talk junk and you think you're so good that you don't have to make any sense! You say you love me and you don't because you just frighten me and torture me for a joke... you say you want to set me free and you put me in a prison...<br>
V: You were already in a prison. You've been in a prison all your life.<br>
Evey: Shut up! I don't want to hear it! I wasn't in a prison! I was happy! I was Happy here until you threw me out.<br>
V: Happiness is a prison, Evey. Happiness is the most insidious prison of all.<br>
Evey: That's warped! That's warped and evil and wrong! When you threw me out I went to live with somebody. I was in love with him. I was happy. If that's a prison, then I don't care.<br>
V: Don't you? Your lover lived in the penitentiary that we are all born into, and was forced to rake the drecs of that world for his living. He knew affection and tenderness but only briefly. Eventually, one of the other inmates stabbed him with a cutlass and he drowned upon his own blood. Is that it, Evey? Is that the happiness worth more than freedom?<br>
Evey: How did you know? How did you know what happened to Gordon?<br>
V: It's not an uncommon story, Evey. Many convicts meet with miserable ends. Your mother. Your father. Your lover. One by one. Taken out behind the chemical sheds... and shot. All convicts, hunched and deformed by the smallness of their cells, the weight of their chains; the unfairness of their sentences... I didn't put you in a prison, Evey. I just showed you the bars.<br>
Evey: You're wrong! It's just life, that's all! It's how life is. It's what we've got to put up with. It's all we've got. What gives you the right to decide it's not good enough?<br>
V: You're in a prison, Evey. You were born in a prison. You've been in a prison so long, you no longer believe there's a world outside.<br>
Evey: Shut up! You're mad! I don't want to hear it!<br>
V: That's because you're afraid, Evey. You're afraid because you can feel freedom closing in upon you. You're afraid because freedom is terrifying.<br>
Evey: I can't feel anything! There's nothing to feel! Leave me alone!<br>
V: Don't back away from it, Evey. Part of you understands the truth even as part pretends not to. Woman, this is the most important moment of your life. Don't run from it.<br>
Evey: I don't know what you are. Oh God. Oh God. I can't breathe. Asthma... when I was... a little girl...<br>
V: Good. You're almost there. Go closer. Feel the shape of it. Your mother died. They took your father away. There's a little girl Evey, and she's screaming...<br>
Evey: Oh, make it stop. Mummy, Daddy, please make it stop! What... are you doing to me? Oh, I can't breathe...<br>
V: You were in a cell, Evey. They offered you a choice between the death of your principles and the death of your body.<br>
Evey: Oh, oh, I can feel it... oh, what is it... oh, I'm going to die, I'm going to burst...<br>
V: You said you'd rather die. You faced the fear of your own death,and you were calm and still. Try to feel now what you felt then.<br>
Evey: I... oh God... I felt... I felt like... an angel. Oh God, V. Oh God, I'm so scared. I'm so cold... what's happening to me?<br>
V: The door of the cage is open, Evey. All that you feel is the wind from outside. Don't be afraid. Try to stand. Try to walk. The lift will take us up to the roof.<br>
Evey: I don't want to be blindfolded...<br>
V: No, Evey. No more blindfolds. All the blindfolds are gone.<br>
Evey: Oh, it's raining. It must be cold.<br>
V: Do you feel it?<br>
Evey: No... V... Everything's so... different... I... I feel so...<br>
V: I know. Five years ago, I too came through a night like this naked under a roaring sky. This night is yours. Seize it. Encircle it within your arms. Bury it in your heart up to the hilt... become transfixed... become transfigured... forever.

Valerie: I don't know who you are. Please believe. There is no way I can convince you that this is not one of their tricks, but I don't care. I am me, and I don't know who you are but I love you. I have a pencil, a little one they did not find. I am a woman. I hid it inside me perhaps I won't be able to write again, so this is a long letter about my life. It is the only autobiography I will ever write and oh God I'm writing it on toilet paper. I was born in Nottingham in 1957, and it rained a lot. I passed my eleven plus and went to girl's grammar. I wanted to be an actress. I met my first girlfriend at school. Her name was Sara. She was fourteen and I was fifteen but we were both in miss Watson's class. Her wrists. Her wrists were beautiful. I sat in biology class, staring at the pickled rabbit fetus in its jar, listening while Mr. Hird said it was an adolescent phase that people outgrew... Sara did. I didn't. In 1976 I stopped pretending and took a girl called Christine home to meet my parents. A week later, I moved to London, enrolling at drama college. My mother said I broke her heart... but it was my integrity that was important. Is that so selfish? It sells for so little, but it's all we have left in this place. It is the very last inch of us... but within that inch we are free!<br>
Captain: Alright. Now, Miss Hammond, let's review the facts. You work for codename V. Codename V kills security officers. Peter Creedy is a security officer. He frequents the Kitty Kat Keller. You were found outside the establishment with a loaded gun. You were planning to murder Mr. Creedy, under the orders of codename V. Isn't that what happened, Miss Hammond?<br>
Evey: No! No, please that isn't true...<br>
Captain: Oh dear Rossiter.
Rossiter: Sir.
Evey: No! Wait! Please don't. (Evey gets waterboarded.)<br>
Valerie: London, I was happy in London... I saw a lot of the scene, but I never felt comfortable there. So many of them just wanted to be gay, it was their life, their ambition, all they talked about. No! I wanted more than that. Work improved. I got small film roles, then bigger ones. In 1986 I starred in the Salt Flats! It pulled in the awards but not the crowds. I met Ruth while working on that. We loved each other. We lived together, and on Valentine's day she sent me roses, and oh God, we had so much. Those were the best three years of my life. In 1988 there was the war and after that there were no more roses. Not for anybody. In 1992, after the take-over, they started rounding up the gays. They took Ruth while she was out looking for food. Why are they so frightened of us? They burned her with cigarette ends and made her give them my name. She signed a statement saying I'd seduced her. I didn't blame her. God. I loved her. I didn't blame her. But she did. She killed herself in her cell. She couldn't live with betraying me, with giving up that last inch. Oh Ruth. They came for me. They told me that all my films would be burned. They shaved off my hair. They held my head down a toilet bowl and told jokes about lesbians. They brought me here and gave me drugs. I can't feel my tongue anymore. I can't speak. The other gay woman here, Rita, died two weeks ago. I imagine I'll die quite soon. It is strange that my life should end in such a terrible place, but for three years I had roses and I apologised to nobody. I shall die here, every inch of me shall perish... except one. An inch. It's small and it's fragile and it's the only thing in the world that's worth having. We must never lose it, or sell it, or give it away. We must never let them take it from us. I don't know who you are, or whether you're a man or woman. I may never see you. I will never hug you or cry with you or get drunk with you. But I love you. I hope that you escape this place. I hope that the world turns and that things get better, and that one day people have roses again. I wish I could kiss you.<br>
Captain: "My name is Eve Hammond. On the fifth of November, 1997, I was abducted by the terrorist known as codename 'V' and then taken against my will to an unknown location. Once there, I was systematically brainwashed by means of drugs and torture, both physical and psychological. I was frequently subjected to sexual abuse during this period. Eventually, I was terrorized into helping him commit murders. These included the unlawful killings of Mr. Roger Dascombe, Mr. Derek Almond, Dr. Delia Surridge and the Reverend Anthony Lilliman, bishop of Westminster. I also undertook the attempted murder of Mr. Peter Creedy. I, the undersigned, swear that the above statement is genuine, and that it was not signed by means of intimidation." We'd like you sign that for us, Miss Hammond. Where we've put the little cross...<br>
Evey: No.<br>
Captain: As you wish. Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell Rossiter, where she will wait while you arrange a wet detail of six men...then take her out behind the chemical sheds and shoot her.<br>
Rossiter: It's time... unless you want to change your mind. Sign that statement. You could be out inside three years. Perhaps they'd find you a job with the Finger. A lot of your sort get work with the Finger.<br>
Evey: Thank you... but I'd rather die behind the chemical sheds.<br>
Rossiter: Then there's nothing left to threaten with, is there? You are free.<br>
Evey: What?

From V For Vendatta<br>
V: I suppose you're wondering why I've called you here this evening. Well, you see, I'm not entirely satisfied with your performance lately... I'm afraid your work's been slipping, and... well, I'm afraid we've been thinking about letting you go. Oh, I know, I know. You've been with the company a long time now. Almost... let me see. Almost ten thousand years! My word, doesn't time fly? It seems like only yesterday... I remember the day you commenced your employment, swinging down from the trees, fresh-faced and nervous, a bone clasped in your bristling fist... "Where do I start, sir?" you asked, plaintively. I recall my exact words: "There's a pile of dinosaur eggs over there, youngster," I said, smiling paternally the while. Well, we've certainly come a long way since then, haven't we? And yes, yes, you're right, in all that time you haven't missed a day.Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Also, please don't think I've forgotten about your outstanding service record, or about all of the invaluable contributions that you've made to the company... fire, the wheel, agriculture... it's an impressive list, old-timer. A jolly impressive list. Don't get me wrong. But... well, to be frank, we've had our problems too. There's no getting away from it. Do you know what I think a lot of it stems from? I'll tell you... it's your basic unwillingness to get on within the company. You don't seem to want to face up to any real responsibility, or to be your own boss. Lord knows, you've been given plenty of opportunities... we've offered you promotion time and time again, and each time you've turned us down. "I couldn't handle the work, guv'nor," you wheedled. "I know my place." To be frank, you're not trying, are you? You see, you've been standing still for far too long. And it's starting to show in your work... and, I might add, in your general standard of behavior. The constant bickering on the factory floor has not escaped my attention... nor the recent bouts of rowdiness in the staff canteen. Then of course there's... hmm. Well, I didn't really want to have to bring this up, but... well, you see, I've been hearing some disturbing rumors about your personal life. No, never you mind who told me. No names, no pack drill... I understand that you are unable to get on with your spouse. I hear that you argue. I am told that you shout. Violence has been mentioned. I am reliably informed that you always hurt the one you love... the one you shouldn't hurt at all. And what about the children? It's always the children who suffer, as you're well aware. Poor little mites. What are they to make of it? What are they to make of your bullying, your despair, your cowardice and all your fondly nurtured bigotries? Really, it's not good enough, is it? And it's no good blaming the drop in work standards upon bad management, either... though, to be sure, the management is very bad. In fact, let us not mince words... the management is terrible! We've had a string of embezzlers, frauds, liars and lunatics making a string of catastrophic decisions. This is plain fact. But who elected them? It was you! You who appointed these people! You who gave them the power to make your decisions for you! While I'll admit that anyone can make a mistake once, to go on making the same lethal errors century after century seems to me nothing short of deliberate. You have encouraged these malicious incompetents, who have made your working life a shambles. You have accepted without question their senseless orders. You have allowed them to fill your workspace with dangerous and unproved machines. You could have stopped them. All you had to say was "No." You have no spine. You have no pride. You are no longer an asset to the company. I will, however, be generous. You will be granted two years to show me some improvement in your work. If at the end of that time you are still unwilling to make a go of it... you're fired. That will be all. You may return to your labours.

Dr. Delia: When I saw you that night... the night you escaped. You were standing against the flames. You turned and you looked straight at me. I knew then that one day you'd come looking for me, that you'd find me. What... what we did, what I did at Larkhill... that terrible knowledge. It's been with me for so long. That I could do things like that. I heard of an experiment once, one the Americans did. They had volunteers working a shock generator. The volunteers were told that it was wired to a patient in an adjoining room... it wasn't. There was only an actor, whose voice could be heard through the intercom. The volunteers were instructed by a doctor to start administering electric shocks. They were told to gradually increase the voltage. The "victim" began begging them to stop. They were told to increase it again. This time the victim started screaming. After a while the screams were choked off to be replaced by silence. The volunteers were told to increase the voltage once more... nearly 80% of those tested carried on administering shocks after the "victim" begged them to stop. Nearly 60% continued even after they believed that they'd killed him. They were ordinary people, and they were prepared to torture a stranger to death just because they were told to by someone in authority. Some of them said they'd even enjoyed it. I think I enjoyed what I did at the time. People are stupid and evil. There's something wrong with us... some hideous flaw.

Evey: "V.V.V.V" it's the inscription on that arch in the big hall. I just wondered what it meant, that's all.<br>
V: It's a quotation. A motto... "vi veri veniversum vivus vici." "By the power of truth, I, while living, have conquered the universe." Latin.<br>
Evey: Hmmm. I suppose you have, sort of. You can do whatever you want, can't you? I suppose that's conquering the universe. Doing what you want.

Commander: My dolls. That's part of my doll collection. How did you... they were all safely locked away when I left for work yesterday... WHAT ARE YOU DONIG WITH MY DOLLS? My God, if you've damaged any of them... they're priceless! Hardly any of the big collections survived the war. If you've damaged them...<br>
V: Admirable concern, commander. Yet it's deuced odd, isn't it? How you can show so much concern for porcelain and plastic... and show so little for flesh and blood. Do you remember, commander? Do you remember when it was people gathered in this sordid little enclosure? People half dead with starvation and dysentery?<br>
Commander: Look, you know as well as I do... we had to do what we did. All the darkies, the nancy boys and the beatniks... it was us or them. Us or them. Don't you understand?

From V For Vendatta<br>
Evey: There were riots, and people with guns. Nobody knew what was going on. Everyone was waiting for the government to do something...but there wasn't any government anymore. Just lots of little gangs. All trying to take over. And then in 1992, somebody finally did... it was all the fascist grouops, the right-wingers. They'd all got together with some of the big corporations that had survived. 'Nosefire' they called themselves. I remember when they marched into London. They had a flag with their symbol on. Everyone was cheering. I thought they were scary. They soon got things under control. But then they started taking people away... all the black people and the Pakistanis... white people, too. All the radicals and the men who, you know, liked other men. The homosexuals. I don't know what they did with them all. Dad had been in a socialist group when he was younger. They came for him one September morning in 1993... it was my birthday, I was twelve. I never saw him again. They made me go and work in a factory with a lof of other kids. We were putting matches into boxes. I lived in  a hostel. It was cold and dirty and I just used to cry all the time. I wanted my dad. That's how it was for four years... not enough food, not enough money. Some of the older girls made money going with men. That's what I was going to do. Last night. But they were Fingermen. They were going... they were g-going to... they were going to ruh... ruh... ruh...<br>
V: Hush child, hush. It's over now. You're safe. The past can't hurt you anymore. Not unless you let it. They made you into a victim, Evey. They made you into a statistic. But that's not the real you. That's not who you are inside. Just trust me, Evey, and we can wipe it all away. All the pain. All the cruelty. All the bereavement. We can start again.

Evey: Last night... those men, they were going to... they said they'd kill me and you rescued me. You rescued me and brought me to this fantastic place and it's so beautiful and it makes me feel so safe and... and... and I don't even know what your name is.<br>
V: I don't have a name. You can call me "V." What shall I call you?<br>
Evey: My name is Evey... Evey Hammond. I'm nobody. Nobody special. Not like you.<br>
V: Everybody is special. Everybody. Everybody is a hero, a lover, a fool, a villain. Everybody. Everybody has their story to tell. Even Evey Hammond. I should very much like to hear Evey Hammond's story.

Andrea: What's your deal, anyway? You're just helping this guy get to Washington? You don't even know what's there for sure? What if everyone dies on your way there?<br>
Abraham: All I know is I'm a problem solver... and while I was sitting around, not really knowing what to do with myself, ready to just eat a bullet... this guy came along with a problem that I think I can solve. He's got to get to Washington, he needs my help. That's something I can wrap my head around. Helps keep me sane, I think.

Eugene: I can't tell her anything, it's all classified.<br>
Abraham: It's classified--he never told us and he can't fucking tell you. Now I know what you're thinking--this guy is crazy--these people are crazy--who the fuck would follow this crazy asshole to Washington D.C. without having any idea what the fuck it is he's actually trying to tell them. And rightly so... because that's what I thought about Eugene when I first met him. What a crazy piece of shit... that was my actual thought. But I was wrong. Once he rubs a needle on some silk to make a compass or makes your headache go away by rubbing a thumb on the side of your head you'll start to realize, Eugene here is one smart motherfucker. The thing about smart motherfuckers is that sometimes, they sound like crazy motherfuckers to stupid motherfuckers... I hope you guys aren't a bunch of stupid motherfuckers... because Eugene here sure as fuck ain't crazy.

From Mary H.K. Choi's Permanent Record<br>
Dad: It's okay that you don't know your major. Truth is you can learn anything through Youtube. Youtube and practice. It's not that mysterious.<br>
Pablo: Easy for you to say. You have an engineering degree from Priceton.<br>
Dad: I didn't love engineering. I liked studying, but that was it. Tell me, do you love anything? Do you enjoy doing anything for the sake of doing it? Life isn't a destination. It's the continual practice of things that make you wiser and happier. Someday I hope to make perfect sourdough bread. I want to learn the piano. I've made peace with the fact that I won't ever make a lot of money, but I make enough to live and eat. The rest goes to your mother. I know you boys think the way I live is depressing or strange, but in art the purporse is in the creation, not the result. Grow as you build. Autotelism. 'Auto' for self and 'telo' for goal. Find joy in the learning, Pablo, not in what it will get you. It took me so much searching to stop searching. Art is fueled by longing but you must learn to want what you have, not get what you want. It's the only way to stop suffering. I pray that you'll know this meaning by the time you're my age.

From the Daily Show with Trevor Noah<br>
Trevor: How do you prevent yourself from going stir crazy when you are stuck in that small environment for so long?<br>
Christina(astronaut): Definitely, I think it's all about how you frame it and your attitude. Just like now with what we're going through, for me, one of the tricks was to put the right thing on repeat in my head so if I found myself putting on repeat in my head "man, I sure wish I could just have a latte" or something ridiculous like that, I would replace it with what I have now that is unique and that I could never have again: "Wow, I'm really gonna be bummed out when I can't look at these auroras from space anymore."" Put something on repeat in your head that serves you that actually flips it...

The One: I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid. You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you, a world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries, a world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.

Tank: What are you talking about?<br>

Trinity: What choice?... What are you doing?<br>
Neo: I'm going in.<br>
Trinity: No you're not.<br>
Neo: I have to.<br>
Trinity: Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself so that he could get you out. There's no way that you're going back in.<br>
Neo: Morpheus did what he did because he believed I am something I'm not.<br>
Trinity: What?<br>
Neo: I'm not the one, Trinity. The Oracle hit me with that too.<br>
Trinity: No. You have to be.<br>
Neo: Sorry, I'm not. I'm just another guy.<br>
Trinity: No, Neo. That's not true. It can't be true.<br>
Neo: Why?<br>
Tank: Neo, this is loco. They've got Morpheus in a military controlled building. Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him. Three of them. I want Morpheus back too, but what you're talking about is suicide.<br>
Neo: I know that's what it looks like, but it's not. I can't explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed. I understand that now. But that's why I have to go.<br>
Tank: Why?<br>
Neo: Because I believe in something.<br>
Trinity: What?<br>

Oracle: I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway. And don't worry about the vase.<br>
Neo: What vase?<br>
Oracle: That vase.<br>
Neo: I'm sorry.<br>
Oracle: I said don't worry about it. I'll get one of my students to fix it.<br>
Neo: How did you know?<br>
Oracle: What's really going to bake your noodle later on is, would you still have broken it if I hadn't said anything? You're cuter than I expected. No wonder she likes you.<br>
Neo: Who?<br>
Oracle: Not too bright, though. You know why Morpheus brought you to see me?<br>
Neo: I think so.<br>
Oracle: So, what do you think? You think you're the one?<br>
Neo: I don't know.<br>
Oracle: You know what that means? It's Latin. Means `Know thyself'. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Being the one is just like being in love. No one can tell you you're in love, you just know it. Through and through. Balls to bones. Well, I better have a look at you. Open your mouth, say Ahhh.<br>
Neo: Ahhh.<br>
Oracle: Okay. Now I'm supposed to say, `Umm, that's interesting, but...' then you say...<br>
Neo: But what?<br>
Oracle: But you already know what I'm going to tell you.<br>
Neo: I'm not the one.<br>
Oracle: Sorry kiddo. You got the gift, but it looks like you're waiting for something.<br>
Neo: What?<br>
Oracle: Your next life maybe, who knows? That's the way these things go. What's funny?<br>
Neo: Morpheus. He...he almost had me convinced.<br>
Oracle: I know. Poor Morpheus. Without him we're lost.<br>
Neo: What do you mean, without him?<br>
Oracle: Are you sure you want to hear this? Morpheus believes in you, Neo. And no one, not you, not even me can convince him otherwise. He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.<br>
Neo: What?<br>
Oracle: You're going to have to make a choice. In the one hand you'll have Morpheus' life and in the other hand you'll have your own. One of you is going to die. Which one will be up to you. I'm sorry, kiddo, I really am. You have a good soul, and I hate giving good people bad news. Oh, don't worry about it. As soon as you step outside that door, you'll start feeling better. You'll remember you don't believe in any of this fate crap. You're in control of your own life, remember? Here, take a cookie. I promise, by the time you're done eating it, you'll feel right as rain.<br>

From The Matrix<br>
Morpheus: The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around. What do you see? Business men, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it. Were you listening to me Neo, or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?<br>
Morpheus: Sentient programs. They can move in and out of any software still hard wired to their system. That means that anyone we haven't unplugged is potentially an agent. Inside the Matrix, they are everyone and they are no one. We are survived by hiding from them, by running from them. But they are the gatekeepers. They are guarding all the doors. They are holding all the keys, which means that sooner or later, someone is going to have to fight them.<br>
Neo: Someone?<br>
Morpheus: I won't lie to you, Neo. Every single man or woman who has stood their ground, everyone who has fought an agent has died. But where they have failed, you will succeed.

	<p id="8">
From The Matrix<br>
Neo: I can't go back, can I?<br>
Morpheus: No. But if you could, would you really want to? I feel I owe you an apology. We have a rule. We never free a mind once it's reached a certain age. It's dangerous, the mind has trouble letting go. I've seen it before and I'm sorry. I did what I did because...I had to. When the Matrix was first built, there was a man born inside who had the ability to change whatever he wanted, to remake the Matrix as he saw fit. It was he who freed the first of us, taught us the truth. As long as the Matrix exists the human race will never be free. After he died the Oracle prophesied his return and that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix and the war, bring freedom to our people. That is why there are those of us who have spent our entire lives searching the Matrix looking for him. I did what I did because I believe that search is over.... Get some rest, you're going to need it.<br>
Neo: For what?<br>
Morpheus: Your training.

	<p id="7">
From The Matrix<br>
Neo: This...this isn't real?<br>
Morpheus: What is real? How do you define real? If you’re talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. This is the world that you know. The world as it was at the end of the twentieth century. It exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation that we call the Matrix. You've been living in a dream world, Neo. This is the world as it exists today.... Welcome to the Desert of the Real. We have only bits and pieces of information but what we know for certain is that at some point in the early twenty-first century all of mankind was united in celebration. We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to AI.<br>
Neo: AI? You mean artificial intelligence?<br>
Morpheus: A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. We don't know who struck first, us or them. But we know that it was us that scorched the sky. At the time they were dependent on solar power and it was believed that they would be unable to survive without an energy source as abundant as the sun. Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate it seems is not without a sense of irony. The human body generates more bio-electricity than a 120-volt battery and over 25,000 BTU's of body heat. Combined with a form of fusion the machines have found all the energy they would ever need. There are fields, endless fields, where human beings are no longer born, we are grown. For the longest time I wouldn't believe it, and then I saw the fields with my own eyes. Watch them liquefy the dead so they could be fed intravenously to the living. And standing there, facing the pure horrifying precision, I came to realize the obviousness of the truth. What is the Matrix? Control. The Matrix is a computer generated dream world built to keep us under control in order to change a human being into this.<br>
Neo: No. I don't believe it. It's not possible.<br>
Morpheus: I didn't say it would be easy, Neo. I just said it would be the truth.<br>
Neo: Stop. Let me out. Let me out. I want out.

Neo: You could say that.<br>
Morpheus: I can see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up. Ironically, this is not far from the truth. Do you believe in fate, Neo?<br>
Neo: No.<br>
Morpheus: Why not?<br>
Neo: Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.<br>
Morpheus: I know exactly what you mean. Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you know you can't explain. But you feel it. You've felt it your entire life. That there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is but it's there, like a splinter in your mind driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about?<br>
Neo: The Matrix?<br>
Morpheus: Do you want to know what IT is? The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us, even now in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.<br>
Neo: What truth?<br>
Morpheus: That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage, born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your mind.... Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. This is your last chance. After this there is no turning back. You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.... Remember, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.

Agent Smith: As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson. It seems that you've been living two lives. In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company, you have a social security number, you pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias Neo and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not. I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson. You're here because we need your help. We know that you've been contacted by a certain individual, a man who calls himself Morpheus. Now whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant. He is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive. My colleagues believe that I am wasting my time with you but I believe that you wish to do the right thing. We're willing to wipe the slate clean, give you a fresh start and all that we're asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.<br>
