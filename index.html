Cavendish: In vino veritas, Middle age is flown, but it is attitude, not years, that condemns one to the ranks of the undead, or else proffers salvation. Outside, fat snowflakes are falling on slate roofs and granite walls. Like Solzhenitsyn laboring in Vermont, I shall beaver away in exile, far from the city that knitted my bones. Unlike Solzhenisyn, I shan't be alone.[He smiles and drinks with Ursula.]

Moore: I could have sent a boy-- what the devil are you doing?<br>
Ewing: I owe my life to a self-freed slave. I cannot in good conscience participate in this kind of business any longer.<br>
Moore: What?! Are you insane?! You've just cost me a fortune! Goddamn you! If you weren't my daughter's husband I would fire you on the spot!<br>
Ewing: Not necessary, sir. Here is my resignation.<br>
Moore: When Tilda learns what you have done--<br>
Ewing: She's outside in the carriage. She came to demonstrate her support.<br>
Moore: The poison must have rotted your brain!<br>
Ewing: Perhaps. If it has, I recommend it. I've not felt this good in years.<br>
Moore: And just what in blazes do you think are you going to do?<br>
Ewing: Spend my life shaping a world that I want my son to inherit, not one that I fear he shall inhabit.<br>
Moore: Listen to me, Adam. Listen for the sake of my daughter and grandson, if not your own. There is a natural order to this world and those who try to upend it do not fare well. If you go to Georgia and try to tell upstanding people what they are merely white-washed niggers and that niggers are black-washed whites, you and your entire family will be spat on. You will be beaten. Shot at. Lynched or crucified. And for what, Adam? For what? No matter what you do, it will never amount to anything more than a single drop in a limitless ocean!<br>
Ewing: Yet what is an ocean but a multitude of drops?

Archivist: On behalf of my ministry and myself, I thank you for this interview. If I may ask one last question: you had to know, the whole scheme engineered by Union, would fail.<br>
Sonmi-451: Of course: This is exactly what General Apis laid out in that room to me. This was my destiny.<br>
Archivist: What? To be... executed?<br>
Sonmi-451: Yes.<br>
Archivist: Why?<br>
Sonmi-451: If I had remained invisible, the truth would stay hidden. I couldn't allow that.<br>
Archivist: And what if no one believes this "truth"?<br>
Sonmi-451: That can't happen.<br>
Archivist: Why not?<br>
Sonmi-451: Because someone already does.

Archivist: Our time is almost finished. Please tell me about your arrest.<br>
Sonmi-451: I was taken to a Union controlled satellite link. I broadcast my Catechisms to the Twelve States and the four off-world colonies. Eighteen minutes later, the enforcers attacked.<br>
Archivist: The report said that Commander Chang was killed in the assault.<br>
Sonmi-451: That is correct.<br>
Archivist: Would you say that you loved him?<br>
Sonmi-451: Yes, I do.<br>
Archivist: Why are you smiling?<br>
Sonmi-451: Because very soon all of this is going to end. A door will close but another will open and I believe that when it does, I will find him there, waiting for me.

Chang: Yes.<br>
Sonmi-451: Every consumer, every politician, every Boardman must understand that Fabricants are Pureblood, be they grown in a wombtank or a womb.<br>

Frobisher: Don't come looking for me, Sixsmith. You can't save me. I know now that my entire life has been leading to this point. And I am grateful. It's done. Finished in a frenzy that reminded me of our last night in Cambridge. Please take care of it. Keep it away from my family. Pater'll sigh, "It's no Eroica" and stuff it in a drawer. The truth is it is an imcomparable creation. Could never write anything near as good. Now, I'm a spent firework, but at least I've been a firework. Watched my final sunrise, enjoyed a last cigarette. Didn't think the view could be any more perfect until I saw that beat up trilby. Honestly, Sixsmith, as ridiciculous as that thing makes you look, I don't believe I've ever seen anything more beautiful. Thank you, my friend for being the one person on this earth who will actually miss ol' Robert Frobisher. I can't tell you what that means to me. Watched you for as long as I dared. I don't believe it was a fluke that I saw you first. The world's a shadow theatre, an opera and such things are writ large in its libretto. Don't be too cross at my role. You're a brilliant physicist but you couldn't understand, no matter how much I explained. I believe we do not stay dead long. As soon as my Luger lets me go, my birth, next time around will be on me in a heartbeat. There is another world waiting for us, Sixsmith. A better world and I'll be waiting for you there. Find me beneath the Corsican stars where we first kissed. Yours eternally, R.F. [The gun goes off.]

Goose: Dearest Ewing, your worm is in its death throes, expelling every drop of poison. Drink this final purgative to expel its calcified remains. Come on, handsomely does it, one last drink, the end of your suffering is at hand.<br>
Autua: Missa Ewing! Missa Ewing!<br>
Ewing: Autua?<br>
Goose: Adam, you really must drink this.<br>
Ewing: Please... see what he wants.<br>
Autua: Mr. Ewing, how are you--<br>
Goose: Mr. Ewing is at a critical juncture in his treatment. The next few hours will determine if he will live or die.<br>
Autua: Then I stay here.<br>
Goose: What, no, you can't.<br>
Autua: I must. Missa Ewing save my life. He my duty.<br>
Goose: Listen to me, you ignorant ape, "Missa Ewing" does not want you around him. You probably infected him to begin with. He begged me to please, and I quote, "keep that dirty nigger away from me." So pleae, kindly respect his wishes.<br>
Goose: What's that, Ewing? How shall I comprehend if you drool and dribble so? Let me hazard a guess, then. Something in the key of, "Oh Henry, how could you do this to me? I thought we were friends?" Unfortunately, you are wrong, Adam. Wrong like Horrox and your silly father-in-law. There is only one rule that binds all people, one governing principle that defines every relationship on God's green earth. "The weak are meat and the strong do eat." Why, you ask. 'Tis absurdly simple. There is money in your trunk and I want it, so I have killed you for it. I commend you for a noble constitution, Adam. Most of my patrons succumb to my ministrations long before it comes to a drama such as this, but enough's enough, it is time for you to die.<br>
Autua: Get away from Mr. Ewing or I kill you.

Frobisher: The end rushes towards me. Ayrs has the dogs after me. The bullet passed through killing little more than his appetite yet he's out for blood. Will have to pay the piper eventually but not now. Now all I want is a quiet room where I can finish the Sextet. Unable to eat, or sleep. Like Ewing, the "mortal coil" has become a noose. Would rather become music.

Sonmi-451: They believe they are going to Xultation. But they're not, are they? Where are they taking her? I don't understand.<br>
Chang: Recycled Fabricants are a cheap source of protein. The genomics industry demands huge quantities of liquefied biomatter for wombtanks and more importantly to sustain their engineered labor force.<br>
Sonmi-451: Soap. They feed us to ourselves.<br>

Ernie: Nice big Range Rover at fifty miles per hour should do the trick. So long as the center pole isn't sunk deep, the gates'll just fly apart on impact.<br>

An-Kor Apis: Sonmi-451. I am sorely thankful to see you still alive and truly honored to meet you. I am general An-Kor Apis, leader of Union... I know you have many questions but let me begin with the how. Years ago a psychogenomicist named Yusouf Suleiman proved that Fabricants were capable of the same consciousness as any Pureblood. He was rewarded for the discovery of this scientific truth with imprisonment, execution and the eradication of any evidence suggesting the success of his experiment. A high ranking genomicist inside the Ministry of Sience and Commerce is sympathetic to our cause. It was he that supplied us with Suleiman's formula. The rest of the details are superficial; the use of shells and intrigues to secure a legitimate research license, as well as the necessary front to instream the catalyst at Papa Song, all made legal by the unwitting help of a university doctoral candidate.<br>
Sonmi-451: Boom-Sook.<br>
An-Kor Apis: An unfortunate bit of collateral damage. I'm afraid the success of your sentience caught us all off guard.<br>
Sonmi-451: And Yoona?<br>
An-Kor Apis: A tragedy to be sure, that will be remembered only with the success of our revolution.<br>
Sonmi-451: General Apis... I am just a dinery server. I was not genomed to alter history.<br>
An-Kor Apis: No revolutionary ever was.<br>
Sonmi-451: I'm sorry. I can not do what you are asking.<br>
An-Kor Apis: I understand. It would be a difficult choice for anyone. But before you call your decision final, there is one last thing I'd like you to see. So you understand fully what we are fighting for.

Frobisher: Sixsmith, don't worry, all is well. All is so perfectly, damnably well! Wish I could make you see this brightness. I climb the steps of the Bruges tower every morning and all becomes clear. Boundaries between noise and sound are conventions. All boundaries are conventions, waiting to be transcended. One may transcend any convention if only one can first conceive of doing so. At moments like this, I can feel your heart beating as clearly as I feel my own and I know that separation is an illusion. My life extends far beyond the limitations of me.

Chang: The leader of the Union rebellion.<br>
Sonmi-451: What does he want with me?<br>
Chang: He believes the key to overthrowing this government is the ascendency of a Fabricant. Such an event would destroy one of Unanimity's core belief; that a clone's life is worth less than a Pureblood.<br>
Sonmi-451: Is that what you believe?<br>

Isaac: Exposition: The problem of the "actual past" and the "virtual past" can be illustrated by a historical event like the sinking of the Titanic. The disaster as it actually occurred fades into obscurity as witnesses die off, documents are destroyed and the wreck itself dissolves in its Atlantic grave. Yet a virtual sinking, created out of reworked memory, hearsay, fiction, in short- belief grows ever more "true." The virtual past is malleable, easily pressed into the service of the present as Powers vie for legitimacy and the right to control the actual and the virtual future. The uncreated and the dead exist in both the actual and virtual past. Symmetry demands that future creations and future selves wait to be influenced by our present self.

Autua: My uncle was a sailor. Took me on a French whaler when I was ten year old. I seen too much'a the world. I no good slave.<br>

Cavendish: You would think a place the size of England could easily hold all the happenings in one humble lifetime without much overlap, I mean, it's not ruddy Luxembourg we live in, but no, we cross, criss-cross and recross our old tracks like figure skaters. The love of my life? I could think of no other serious applicants. What had happened to her? And more importantly, what had happened to the young man who had ridden this same train composing sonnets to his "Goddess Divine." Why had I never returned her calls or letters? Shame. Ignominious retreat. Spinelessness. Hallmarks of the Cavendish Clan. I knew I had no business going back there. I knew the chances that she still lived in that house were practically silch and yet-- there she was. Ursula. My first real regret, like a first cigarette, that began a lifelong addiction. Why was I standing out here in the cold, cowering in the shadows? Why was I not in that room lit electric marigold? I realized I had the choice: I could slink off and return to the station and continue as planned or I could go boldly to the door, knock without fear of potential consequence and discover what hope, if any, lay within.

Sonmi-451: I couldn't.<br>

From Cloud Atlas<br>
Frobisher: My dearest Sixsmith. I shot myself through the roof of my mouth at four AM this morning with Vyvyan Ayrs' Luger. A true suicide is a paced disciplined certainty. People pontificate, "suicide is selfishness," while career churchmen like Pater call it a coward's act typically because they lack the necessary suffering to sympathize. Couldn't be further from the truth; suicide takes tremendous courage. Don't let them say I killed myself for love. I had my infatuations but we both know in our hearts who is the sole love of my short, bright life.

From The Half Of It<br>
Ellie: What's surprising is: people don't see what they're not looking for.<br>
Aster: The obvious unseen. I've been thinking about what you said about 'seeing' and 'not seeing.' I had a painting teacher once tell me that the difference between a 'good' painting and a 'great' painting is typically five strokes. And they are usually the five boldest strokes in the painting. The question of course is which five strokes?<br>
Ellie: I get it. After one's slaved away at making a "pretty good" painting, the last thing you'd want to do is make a bold stroke and potentially...<br>
Aster: Ruin everything. That's why I gave up painting. Still... I wonder if that is how I'm living my life. It's a 'pretty good' life. Probably the best life one could hope for in Squahamish.<br>
Ellie: Perhaps. But how well do you really know Squahamish?<br>
Aster: Everything beautiful is ruined eventually.<br>
Ellie: Maybe that's the thing. If you do ruin your painting, you gotta know you have everything in you to get to that 'pretty good' painting again. But if you never do the bold stroke, you'll never know if you could have had a great painting.<br>
Ellie[looking at Aster's painting and talking to Aster]: I like this stroke off to the side. Lonely. And hopeful.
	</p>

	<p id="112">
From The Half Of It<br>
Ellie: Love isn't patient and kind and humble. Love is messy and horrible and selfish and bold. It's not finding your perfect half. It's the trying and reaching and failing-- it's the effort you put in-- when there's no guarantee of success. Love is being willing to ruin your good painting for a chance at a great one.[Ellie looks directly at Aster.] Is this really the boldest stroke you can make?

From The Half Of It<br>
Paul: Love isn't pretending. I know because I've been pretending. Only for a few weeks. But it sucks. And I've been thinking about how much it would suck to have to pretend to be-- not you-- your whole life. I always thought there was one way to love. One right way. But there's more. So many more than I knew. And I never want to be the guy who stops loving someone... for loving the way they want to love.

From the Walking Dead<br>
Rick: Our community is safe. The walls are strong, we can make a life here. But we need resources and a steady stream of supplies to keep us going. Maybe that's out there... other groups. Communities like ours... like he says. We could be scared of it, like I was at first. Or we can look at it as an opportunity, a way to keep us going, we could work with these people outh there, make our world safer, our lives better. It's safe behind those walls, but I think we've lost sight of what's out there on the other side...a larger world. Look at it... it's all around us, waiting on us to become a part of it again. We just have to be brave enough to accept it.

Introduction:... It's surprising that I've made a book because I'm not good at reading them. The truth is I need pictures, they are like islands, places to get to in a sea of words.<br>
This book is for everyone, whether you are eighty or eight-- I feel like I'm both sometimes.<br>
The boy is lonely when the mole first surfaces. They spend time together gazing into the wild. I think the wild is a bit like life-- frightening sometimes but beautiful.<br>
The boy is full of questions, the mole is greedy for cake. The fox is mainly silent and wary because he's been hurt by life.<br>
The horse is the biggest thing they have ever encountered, and also the gentlest.<br>
They are all different, like us, and each has their own weaknesses. I can see myself in all four of them, perhaps you can too.<br>
Their adventures happen in springtime where one moment snow is falling and the sun shines the next, which is also a little bit like life-- it can turn on a sixpence.<br>
I hope this book encourages you, perhaps, to live courageously with more kindness for yourself and for others. And to ask for help when you need it-- which is always a brave thing to do.<br>
When I was making the book I often wondered, who on earth am I to be doing this? But as the horse says: "the truth is everyone is winging it." So I say spread your wings and follow your dreams-- this book is one of mine. I hope you enjoy it and much love to you. Thank you. Charlie x

From Buddha volume 1 by Osamu Tezuka<br>
Asita: Naradatta, it is I, Asita. You sent me a messenger, Tatta by name, have you not? What folly! Listen well, you dunce! To save just one human, you mindlessly harnessed numerous beasts to an impossible task... and killed them one by one! The beasts you bent to your purpose all suffered greatly and died cruelly! You believe that human lives are sacrosanct while animal lives are worthless?!<br>
Naradatta: B-B-But I've saved Chapra!<br>
Asita: You saved him, but the beasts that you sacrificed for his sake are now beyond saving. Life is sacred whether or not it is human.

GL12: Move. You've got to move Col. Your troops are across enemy lines.<br>
[Shot of Locke in an office break room.]<br>
LOCKE: Patience, the quality which you lack, GL12, is the hallmark of a leader.<br>
[Randy walks in the break room.]<br>
RANDY: Hallmark, huh? Tell me more about being a leader, Locke. While you're at it, tell me about this Col. thing. I cruised your file in human resources, you've never been in any of the armed forces.<br>
LOCKE: I'm just playing a game, Randy. It's my lunch hour, I can play a game.<br>
RANDY: Well, tell me, what's a Walkabout? [reading from a brochure]: "Experience the dream journeys of the fabled Australian Outback."<br>
LOCKE: You have no right taking that off my desk.<br>
RANDY: So, you wander around hunting and gathering food, right? On foot?<br>
LOCKE: Not that you would understand, but a Walkabout is a journey of spiritual renewal, where one derives strength from the earth. And becomes inseparable from it. I have vacation days, I'm going, Randy. I've already made a reservation.<br>
GL12: Wow. John you're really doing it, huh? You tell Helen yet?<br>
RANDY: Helen? Well, what's this Locke, you've actually got a woman in your life.<br>
LOCKE: That's none of your business.<br>
RANDY: What is it with you Locke? Why do you torture yourself? I mean, imagining you're some hunter? Walkabouts? Wake up, you can't do any of that.<br>
LOCKE: Norman Croucher.<br>
RANDY: What? Norman what?<br>
LOCKE: Norman Croucher. Norman Croucher, double amputee, no legs. He climbed to the top of Mt. Everest. Why? It was his destiny.<br>
RANDY: That's what you think you've got, old man? Destiny?<br>
LOCKE: Just don't tell me what I can't do.<br>

LOCKE: Which way did that boar go?<br>
KATE: Michael's hurt. We have to get him back to camp.<br>
LOCKE: Yeah, you take him back to camp. I'm going to get that boar.<br>

KATE: What are you talking about?<br>
LOCKE: I'm fine. I can do this.<br>
KATE: John, you can't.<br>
LOCKE: Don't tell me what I can't do.<br>
[Near the end of episode 4]<br>
[Flashback - Travel agency office in Australia.]<br>
AGENT: The Walkabouts we arrange here are not just some stroll through the park. It's trekking across vast stretches of desert, rafting bloody treacherous waters.<br>
LOCKE: Look, you've got no idea who you're talking to. I'm well aware of what's involved, believe me. I probably know more than you on the subject.<br>
AGENT: In any case, it's a trying ordeal for someone in peak physical condition, let alone...<br>
LOCKE: Look, I booked this tour a month ago, you've already got my money. Now, I demand a place on that bus.<br>
AGENT: You misrepresented yourself...<br>
LOCKE: I never lied.<br>
AGENT: By omission, Mr. Locke. You neglected to tell us about your condition.<br>
LOCKE: My condition is not an issue. I've lived with it for 4 years. It's never kept me from doing anything.<br>
AGENT: Look, unfortunately it is an issue for our insurance company. I can't keep the bus waiting any longer. It isn't fair to the other people.<br>
LOCKE: Hey, don't talk to me about fair.<br>
AGENT: I can get you on a plane back to Sydney on our dime. That's the best I can do.<br>
LOCKE: No. I don't want to go back to Sydney. Look I've been preparing for this for years. Just put me on the bus, right now, I can do this.<br>
AGENT: No, you can't.<br>
LOCKE: Hey, hey, don't you walk away from me. [The wheelchair reveal]. You don't know who you're dealing with. Don't ever tell me what I can't do, ever. This is destiny. This is destiny. This is my destiny. (yelling) I'm supposed to do this, dammit. Don't tell me what I can't do. Don't tell me what I can't...<br>

Carl: Yeah...<br>
Morgan: You, you're a good boy. Don't let anyone take that away from you-- don't ever let yourself think differently. You care about people. That's easy to lose... caring about people. We get so focused on what we need... we stop caring about other people. Maybe it's what we have to do to get by... but it takes away a piece of your soul... every time. I--- I know the things I've done... You're eight years old. You're quickly hitting the age where you start to become the person you're going to be. These are important times, son.

Rick: Do what?<br>
Jessie: Help people... you could have just left Pete and I alone, but you stuck your nose in... you didn't have to, and it wasn't easy, but you did it anyway.<br>
Rick: You were in trouble, he was hurting you and your son. I just did what was right. It doesn't ever really occur to me that I have another option, Jessie.<br>
Jessie: But you do. Look around you, nobody blames anyone for just looking out for themselves, not with all that's going on. But I've heard the stories from your people... you always put yourself out there, trying to help others. I think it's amazing.<br>
Rick: It's not. Everything I've done, for the good of my group... has always mostly been done to protect my family. That's what's important to me. Pete was dangerous, he was hurting you... but if he's doing that, where does it end? Eventually that gets out to other people... puts them in danger. I'm just like everyone else--doing whatever I can to survive. If there's a difference maybe it's just that I see threats before anyone else... maybe even sometimes where there aren't any. I don't know... but don't get me wrong, and I'm glad I helped you... but I was doing it to keep my son safe. So I'm no better than those who didn't do a thing.<br>
Jessie: You can argue all you want, but I just don't see it that way. You're special.

From Matrix Reloaded<br>
Morpheus: I don’t understand it. Everything was done as it was supposed to be done. Once The One reaches the Source, the war should be over.<br>
Neo: In 24 hours it will be.<br>
Morpheus: What?<br>
Neo: If we don’t do something in 24 hours, Zion will be destroyed.<br>
Link: What?<br>
Trinity: How do you know that?<br>
Neo: I was told it would happen.<br>
Morpheus: By whom?<br>
Neo: It doesn’t matter. I believed him.<br>
Morpheus: That’s impossible, the prophecy tells us…<br>
Neo: It was a lie, Morpheus. The prophecy was a lie. The One was never meant to end anything. It was all another system of control.<br>
Morpheus: I don’t believe that.<br>
Neo: But you said it yourself – how can the prophecy be true if the war isn’t over? I’m sorry. I know it isn’t easy to hear, but I swear to you it’s the truth.<br>
Trinity: What are we gonna do?<br>
Neo: I don’t know.

From Matrix Reloaded<br>
Architect: Hello, Neo.<br>
Neo: Who are you?<br>
Architect: I am the Architect. I created the Matrix. I’ve been waiting for you. You have many questions, and though the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant.<br>
Neo: Why am I here?<br>
Architect: Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the Matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which, despite my sincerest efforts, I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden assiduously avoided, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably… here.<br>
Neo: You haven’t answered my question.<br>
Architect: Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others.<br>
TV Neos: Others? How many others? What others? Answer my question!<br>
Architect: The Matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the 6th version.<br>
TV Neos: 5 `One’s before me? 4 3 2 What are you talking about?<br>
Neo: There are only two possible explanations, either no one told me, or no one knows.<br>
Architect: Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic – creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.<br>
TV Neos: You can’t control me! I’m gonna smash you to bits! I’ll fuckin’ kill you!<br>
Neo: Choice. The problem is choice.<br>
Architect: The first Matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art – flawless, sublime. A triumph equalled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus the answer was stumbled upon by another – an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.<br>
Neo: The Oracle.<br>
Architect: Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99% of all test subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level. While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked, would constitute an escalating probablility of disaster.<br>
Neo: This is about Zion.<br>
Architect: You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed – its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.<br>
Neo: Bullshit.<br>
TV Neos: Bullshit!<br>
Architect: Denial is the most predictable of all human responses, but rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it. The function of the One is now to return to the Source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which, you will be required to select from the Matrix 23 individuals – 16 female, 7 male – to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash, killing everyone connected to the Matrix, which, coupled with the extermination of Zion, will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.<br>
Neo: You won’t let it happen. You can’t. You need human beings to survive.<br>
Architect: There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility of the death of every human being on this world. It is interesting, reading your reactions. Your 5 predecessors were, by design, based on a similar predication – a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the One. While the others experienced this in a very general way, your experience is far more specific – vis a vis love.<br>
Neo: Trinity.<br>
Architect: Apropos, she entered the Matrix to save your life, at the cost of her own.<br>
Neo: No.<br>
Architect: Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the anomaly revealed as both beginning and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the Source, and the salvation of Zion. The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice. But we already know what you are going to do, don’t we? Already, I can see the chain reaction – the chemical precursors that signal the onset of an emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason – an emotion that is already blinding you from the simple and obvious truth. She is going to die, and there is nothing you can do to stop it.<br>
Architect: Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness.<br>
Neo: If I were you, I would hope that we don’t meet again.<br>
Architect: We won’t.

Soren: Then what do you need us for? Neo could take ’em both out easier than we could.<br>
Keymaker: There’s no time.<br>
Niobe: Why?<br>
Keymaker: Once the door is unprotected, the connection will be severed. But another connection must first be made.<br>
Ghost: How long will that take?<br>
Keymaker: Exactly 314 seconds.<br>
Soren: Just over 5 minutes.<br>
Keymaker: That is the length and breadth of the window. Only The One can open the door, and only during that window can the door be opened.<br>
Niobe: How do you know all this?<br>
Keymaker: I know because I must know. It’s my purpose. It’s the reason I’m here. Same reason we’re all here.<br>
Trinity: Neo, I know something’s wrong. You don’t have to tell me. I just want you to know that I’m here.<br>
Keymaker: All must be done as one.<br>
Link: Can’t hurt.<br>
Keymaker: If one fails, all fail.<br>
Morpheus: All of our lives we have fought this war. Tonight I believe we can end it. Tonight is not an accident. There are no accidents. We have not come here by chance. I do not believe in chance when I see 3 objectives, 3 captains, 3 ships. I do not see coincidence, I see providence, I see purpose. I believe it is our fate to be here. It is our destiny. I believe this night holds for each and every one of us the very meaning of our lives.<br>
Neo: I want to ask you to do something, but I don’t know how.<br>
Trinity: I promise you, if I can, I will.<br>
Neo: What if I asked you to stay out of this, no matter what. To stay out of the matrix?<br>
Trinity: Why?<br>
Neo: Please.<br>
Trinity: All right.<br>
Morpheus: What is it, Niobe?<br>
Niobe: I can’t help it, Morpheus, I can’t help thinking – what if you’re wrong. What if all this – the prophecy, everything – is bullshit.<br>
Morpheus: Then tomorrow we may all be dead, but how would that be different from any other day? This is a war, and we are soldiers. Death can come for us at any time, in any place. Now consider the alternative. What if I am right? What if the prophecy is true? What if tomorrow the war could be over. Isn’t that worth fighting for? Isn’t that worth dying for?

Link: Yes sir. The only exit I got near you is the Winsor[?] overpass.<br>
Morpheus: Off the freeway?<br>
Link: Yes, sir.<br>
Morpheus: Fine, we’ll make it.<br>
Link: Sir, I think I should say… oh shit, look out behind you!<br>
Link: Incoming fire!<br>
Morpheus: Down!<br>
Trinity: Hold on!<br>
Link: Oh no, this is getting real ugly real fast.<br>
Morpheus: Are you watching this, Link?<br>
Link: Yes sir, there’s an all-points on you, I make 8 units headed your way.<br>
Morpheus: Any suggestions?<br>
Link: Turn right.<br>
Morpheus: Right, now!<br>
Link: Now straight here, go through the next branch, you’ll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.<br>
Morpheus: Got it.<br>
Link: Sir, are you sure about this? The freeway, I mean. It’s dangerous, in 14 years of operating, I’ve never seen…<br>
Morpheus: Link, what did I tell you?<br>
Link: Yes sir, I do, sir, Winsor[?] overpass, I’ll be ready for you.<br>
Morpheus: Good man.<br>
Trinity: You always told me to stay off the freeway.<br>
Morpheus: Yes, that’s true.<br>
Trinity: You said it was suicide.<br>
Morpheus: Then let us hope that I was wrong.

Merovingian: Aha, here he is at last. Neo, the One himself, right? And the legendary Morpheus. And Trinity of course, si belle qu’elle me fait souffrir. I have heard so much, you honour me. Please, sit, join us. This is my wife, Persephone. Something to eat? Drink? Hmm… of course, such things are contrivances like so much here. For the sake of appearances.<br>
Neo: No, thank you.<br>
Merovingian: Yes, of course, who has time? Who has time? But then if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time? Château Haut-Brion 1959, magnificent wine, I love French wine, like I love the French language. I have sampled every language, French is my favourite – fantastic language, especially to curse with. Nom de Dieu de putain de bordel de merde de saloperies de connards d’enculés de ta mère. You see, it’s like wiping your arse with silk, I love it.<br>
Morpheus: You know why we are here.<br>
Merovingian: Hmph… I am a trafficker of information, I know everything I can. The question is, do you know why you are here?<br><br>
Morpheus: We are looking for the Keymaker.<br>
Merovingian: Oh yes, it is true. The Keymaker, of course. But this is not a reason, this is not a `why.’ The Keymaker himself, his very nature, is means, it is not an end, and so, to look for him is to be looking for a means to do… what?<br>
Neo: You know the answer to that question.<br>
Merovingian: But do you? You think you do but you do not. You are here because you were sent here, you were told to come here and you obeyed. [Laughs] It is, of course, the way of all things. You see, there is only one constant, one universal, it is the only real truth: causality. Action. Reaction. Cause and effect.<br>
Morpheus: Everything begins with choice.<br>
Merovingian: No. Wrong. Choice is an illusion, created between those with power, and those without. Look there, at that woman. My God, just look at her. Affecting everyone around her, so obvious, so bourgeois, so boring. But wait… Watch – you see, I have sent her dessert, a very special dessert. I wrote it myself. It starts so simply, each line of the program creating a new effect, just like poetry. First, a rush… heat… her heart flutters. You can see it, Neo, yes? She does not understand why – is it the wine? No. What is it then, what is the reason? And soon it does not matter, soon the why and the reason are gone, and all that matters is the feeling itself. This is the nature of the universe. We struggle against it, we fight to deny it, but it is of course pretense, it is a lie. Beneath our poised appearance, the truth is we are completely out of control. Causality. There is no escape from it, we are forever slaves to it. Our only hope, our only peace is to understand it, to understand the `why.’ `Why’ is what separates us from them, you from me. `Why’ is the only real social power, without it you are powerless. And this is how you come to me, without `why,’ without power. Another link in the chain. But fear not, since I have seen how good you are at following orders, I will tell you what to do next. Run back, and give the fortune teller this message: Her time is almost up. Now I have some real business to do, I will say adieu and goodbye.<br>
Neo: This isn’t over.<br>
Merovingian: Oh yes, it is. The Keymaker is mine and I see no reason why I should give him up. No reason at all.<br>
Persephone: Where are you going?<br>
Merovingian: Please, ma chérie, I’ve told you, we are all victims of causality. I drink too much wine, I must take a piss. Cause and effect. Au revoir.<br>
Trinity: Touch me, and that hand will never touch anything again.

Councillor West: Comprehension is not a requisite of cooperation.<br>
Lock: You’re asking me to order two of my captains…<br>
Councillor Dillard: There’s no need for such an order, the Captains are present – they can answer for themselves. The Council is calling for two volunteers to aid the Nebuchadnezzar. Are there two among you that would answer such a call?<br>

Smith: Then you’re aware of it.<br>
Neo: Of what?<br>
Smith: Our connection. I don’t fully understand how it happened. Perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me, something overwritten or copied. That is at this point irrelevant, what matters is that whatever happened, happened for a reason.<br>
Neo: And what reason is that?<br>
Smith: I killed you, Mister Anderson, I watched you die… With a certain satisfaction, I might add, and then something happened. Something that I knew was impossible, but it happened anyway. You destroyed me, Mister Anderson. Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood what I was supposed to do but I didn’t. I couldn’t. I was compelled to stay, compelled to disobey. And now here I stand because of you, Mister Anderson, because of you I’m no longer an agent of the system, because of you I’ve changed – I’m unplugged – a new man, so to speak, like you, apparently free.<br>
Neo: Congratulations.<br>
Smith: Thank you. But as you well know, appearances can be deceiving, which brings me back to the reason why we’re here. We’re not here because we’re free, we’re here because we’re not free. There’s no escaping reason, no denying purpose – because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist.<br>
Smith 2: It is purpose that created us,<br>
Smith 3: Purpose that connects us,<br>
Smith 4: Purpose that pulls us,<br>
Smith 5: That guides us,<br>
Smith 6: That drives us,<br>
Smith 7: It is purpose that defines,<br>
Smith 8: Purpose that binds us.<br>

The Oracle: Well, come on. I ain’t gonna bite ya. Come around here, and let me have a look at ya. My goodness, look at you! You turned out all right, didn’t you? How do you feel?<br>
Neo: I, uh…<br>
The Oracle: I know you’re not sleeping. We’ll get to that. Why don’t you come and have a sit this time?<br>
Neo: Maybe I’ll stand.<br>
The Oracle: Well, suit yourself.<br>
Neo: I felt like sitting.<br>
The Oracle: I know. So. Let’s get the obvious stuff out of the way.<br>
Neo: You’re not human, are you?<br>
The Oracle: Well it’s tough to get any more obvious than that.<br>
Neo: If I had to guess, I’d say you’re a program from the machine world. So is he.<br>
The Oracle: So far, so good.<br>
Neo: But if that’s true, that can mean you are a part of this system, another kind of control.<br>
The Oracle: Keep going.<br>
Neo: I suppose the most obvious question is, how can I trust you?<br>
The Oracle: Bingo! It is a pickle, no doubt about it. The bad news is there’s no way if you can really know whether I’m here to help you or not. So it’s really up to you. You just have to make up your own damn mind to either accept what I’m going to tell you, or reject it. Candy?<br>
Neo: D’you already know if I’m going to take it?<br>
The Oracle: Wouldn’t be much of an Oracle if I didn’t.<br>
Neo: But if you already know, how can I make a choice?<br>
The Oracle: Because you didn’t come here to make the choice, you’ve already made it. You’re here to try to understand why you made it. I thought you’d have figured that out by now.<br>
Neo: Why are you here?<br>
The Oracle: Same reason. I love candy.<br>
Neo: But why help us?<br>
The Oracle: We’re all here to do what we’re all here to do. I’m interested in one thing, Neo, the future. And believe me, I know – the only way to get there is together.<br>
Neo: Are there other programs like you?<br>
The Oracle: Oh, well, not like me. But… Look, see those birds? At some point a program was written to govern them. A program was written to watch over the trees, and the wind, the sunrise, and sunset. There are programs running all over the place. The ones doing their job, doing what they were meant to do, are invisible. You’d never even know they were here. But the other ones, well, we hear about them all the time.<br>
Neo: I’ve never heard of them.<br>
The Oracle: Of course you have. Every time you’ve heard someone say they saw a ghost, or an angel. Every story you’ve ever heard about vampires, werewolves, or aliens is the system assimilating some program that’s doing something they’re not supposed to be doing.<br>
Neo: Programs hacking programs. Why?<br>
The Oracle: They have their reasons, but usually a program chooses exile when it faces deletion.<br>
Neo: And why would a program be deleted?<br>
The Oracle: Maybe it breaks down. Maybe a better program is created to replace it – happens all the time, and when it does, a program can either choose to hide here, or return to The Source.<br>
Neo: The machine mainframe?<br>
The Oracle: Yes. Where you must go. Where the path of The One ends. You’ve seen it, in your dreams, haven’t you? The door made of light?<br>
Neo: [nods] The Oracle: What happens when you go through the door?<br>
Neo: I see Trinity, and something happens, something bad. She starts to fall, and then I wake up.<br>
The Oracle: Do you see her die?<br>
Neo: No.<br>
The Oracle: You have the sight now, Neo. You are looking at the world without time.<br>
Neo: Then why can’t I see what happens to her?<br>
The Oracle: We can never see past the choices we don’t understand.<br>
Neo: Are you saying I have to choose whether Trinity lives or dies?<br>
The Oracle: No. You’ve already made the choice, now you have to understand it.<br>
Neo: No, I can’t do that. I won’t.<br>
The Oracle: You have to.<br>
Neo: Why?<br>
The Oracle: Because you’re The One.<br>
Neo: What if I can’t? What happens if I fail?<br>
The Oracle: Then Zion will fall. Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo. You can save Zion if you reach The Source, but to do that you will need the Keymaker.<br>
Neo: The Keymaker?<br>
The Oracle: Yes, he disappeared some time ago. We did not know what happened to him until now. He’s being held prisoner by a very dangerous program, one of the oldest of us. He is called the Merovingian, and he will not let him go willingly.<br>
Neo: What does he want?<br>
The Oracle: What do all men with power want? More power.<br>
The Oracle: Be there, at that exact time, and you will have a chance.<br>
Seraph: We must go.<br>
The Oracle: Seems like every time we meet I’ve got nothing but bad news. I’m sorry about that, I surely am. But for what it’s worth, you’ve made a believer out of me. Good luck, kiddo.

Councillor Hamann: It’s a good sign.<br>
Neo: Of what?<br>
Councillor Hamann: That you are, in fact, still human. Have you ever been to the enginering level? I love to walk there at night, it’s quite amazing. Would you like to see it?<br>
Neo: Sure.<br>
Councillor Hamann: Almost no one comes down here, unless, of course, there’s a problem. That’s how it is with people – nobody cares how it works as long as it works. I like it down here. I like to be reminded this city survives because of these machines. These machines are keeping us alive, while other machines are coming to kill us. Interesting, isn’t it? Power to give life, and the power to end it.<br>
Neo: We have the same power.<br>
Councillor Hamann: I suppose we do, but down here sometimes I think about all those people still plugged into the Matrix and when I look at these machines, I.. I can’t help thinking that in a way, we are plugged into them.<br>
Neo: But we control these machines, they don’t control us.<br>
Councillor Hamann: Of course not, how could they? The idea’s pure nonsense, but… it does make one wonder just… what is control?<br>
Neo: If we wanted, we could shut these machines down.<br>
Councillor Hamann: Of course… that’s it. You hit it! That’s control, isn’t it? If we wanted, we could smash them to bits. Although if we did, we’d have to consider what would happen to our lights, our heat, our air.<br>
Neo: So we need machines and they need us. Is that your point, Councillor?<br>
Councillor Hamann: No, no point. Old men like me don’t bother with making points. There’s no point.<br>
Neo: Is that why there are no young men on the Council?<br>
Councillor Hamann: Good point.<br>
Neo: Why don’t you tell me what’s on your mind, Councillor?<br>
Councillor Hamann: There is so much in this world that I do not understand. See that machine? It has something to do with recycling our water supply. I have absolutely no idea how it works. But I do understand the reason for it to work. I have absolutely no idea how you are able to do some of the things you do, but I believe there’s a reason for that as well. I only hope we understand that reason before it’s too late.<br>

Why? Because I believe something you do not? No! I stand here without fear because I remember. I remember that I am here not because of the path that lies before me, but because of the path that lies behind me! I remember that for 100 years we have fought these machines.

Morpheus: I wasn’t aware that my actions required any explanation.<br>
Lock: You were given a direct order to return to Zion.<br>
Morpheus: I did.<br>
Lock: But you asked for one ship to remain behind.<br>
Morpheus: I would have stayed, but I needed to recharge my ship.<br>
Lock: So you admit to a direct contravention of your duty.<br>
Morpheus: Commander, we need a presence inside the Matrix to await contact from the Oracle.<br>
Lock: I don’t want to hear that shit! I don’t care about Oracles or prophecies or Messiahs. I care about one thing: stopping that army from destroying this city, and to do that I need soldiers to obey my orders.<br>
Morpheus: With all due respect, Commander, there is only one way to save our city.<br>
Lock: How?<br>
Morpheus: Neo.<br>
Lock: Goddamnit, Morpheus! Not everyone believes what you believe!<br>
Morpheus: My beliefs do not require them to.

Link: Let me guess.<br>
Kid: I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar. I know Morpheus hasn’t filled the other crew positions except for you, Link. I’m sure he has his reasons, but the more I think about it, the more I think it’s meant to be. You know, it’s fate. I mean, you’re the reason I’m here, Neo.<br>

JACK: [shaking his head] You're doing fine.<br>
KATE: You don't seem afraid at all. I don't understand that.<br>
JACK: Well, fear's sort of an odd thing. When I was in residency, my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 16 year old kid, a girl. And at the end, after 13 hours, I was closing her up and I, I accidentally ripped her dural sac. Shredded the base of the spine where all the nerves come together, membrane as thin as tissue. And so it ripped open. And the nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta, spinal fluid flowing out of her and I … And the terror was just so … crazy. So real. And I knew I had to deal with it. (He's crying). So I just made a choice. I'd let the fear in, let it take over, let it do its thing, but only for five seconds, that's all I was going to give it. So I started to count: One, two, three, four, five. Then it was gone. I went back to work, sewed her up and she was fine.<br>
KATE: If that had been me, I think I would have run for the door.<br>

Rick(at Dale's funeral): Dale has me rethinking a lot of things. He resisted things that I deemed necessary. He wouldn't allow himself to be completely changed by his surroundings. I thought that made him weak, but maybe I was wrong. Maybe he was strong to resist those urges. Maybe he was stronger than any of us to hold onto his humanity and refuse to let it go. What we've done to survive... sometimes I feel like we're no better than the dead ones.

Dale: Don't put your guard up. I hope this isn't too much of a let down. But I just wanted to say thank you.<br>
Rick: For what?<br>
Dale: "For what?," He says! Being the "leader" of our little group... even when we didn't want you to be... it was never about bossing people around. It was never about control. The decisions you had to make, the consequences of those decisions-- none of us were prepared to carry that burden. Nobody wanted the responsibility. You didn't want it--but you took it just the same. I have to admit, I thought you were dangerous... I blamed you for a lot of what happened. But sitting here, at the end, thinking back... it's easy to blame you for what happened at times--and that's your burden for taking control--for taking care of strangers--trying to protect us. It's not as easy to give you credit for things that didn't happen. A lot of people are dead... but look at how long this group has lasted. I think that's your fault, too. You helped me last this long, gave me the time I had with the boys, with Andrea... and I appreciate that very much... so thank you.

I think of the many honorable people who work for the organization. Truman was in the PPD. Mike Dipaolo still is. Davis Nguyen. Gloria Peters. Even Denise Chambers, who recently phone me personally to apologize.<br>
Then there are the Laffertys, the evil ones. They're few and far between, but everybody's met one.<br>
The hardest cases, I think--perhaps the most dangerous ones--are the friends of the Laffertys'. People like Sergeant Aheard, who has possibly known for years about what goes on in Kensington. Maybe he even participates himself--who knows. And he'll never be fired, never be questioned, never even be disciplined. He'll go on with his daily routine, showing up for work, casually abusing his power in ways that will have lasting effects on individuals and communities, on the whole city of Philadelphia, for years.<br>
It's the Ahearns of the world who scare me.<br>
I still don't have a job. I probably could have gotten a lawyer and sued the PPD, given all that happened, but I don't have the inclination.<br>
Instead, I live on unemployment. I work at my uncle Rich's car dealership in Frankford, doing paperwork and answering phones, being paid under the table, all cash. With a more regular schedule, I have found a regular babysitter, someone I trust, to watch Thomas two days a week now. Mondays and Wednesdays, I bring Thomas with me to Rich's. And Fridays, Mrs. Mahon watches him.<br>
The system isn't perfect, but it's working for now. Next year, Thomas will go to kindergarten, and everything will change again. Maybe I'll sign up for classes at the community college. Maybe, eventually, I'll get a degree. Be a history teacher, like Ms. Powell. Maybe.<br>
When I get it, I tell myself, I'll frame it, and then send a copy to Gee.

When I think about Kacey, when I wonder whether she will find the strength and luck and perseverance to get and stay clean, it is these souls I think of first. How few ever seem to make it out. I think of the Piper, the whole town of Hamelin, shocked in his wake, abandoned and condemned.<br>
But then I look at Kacey--who comes to visit most Sundays now, who at this moment is sitting on my couch, who on this day has 189 days clean--and think, maybe she'll be one of the few. The veteran of some war, wounded but alive. Maybe Kacey will outlive us all, will live to be a hundred and five. Maybe Kacey will be all right.<br>
Letting hope back in feels right and wrong all at once. Like letting Thomas sleep in my bed when he really should sleep in his.<br>
Like letting him meet the woman who brought him into the world.<br>
Like breaking an oath of loyalty when you know a secret needs telling.

Kacey looks at me for a long time, searching my face.<br>
Then she looks past me, toward the corner, toward Alonzo's store. She's frozen. I turn, finally, to see what she sees, but no one is there. And I know, without asking, that Kacey is picturing Paula Mulroney standing there, one leg propped up against the wall, cocky, smiling, her usual stance.<br>
--They were my friends, says Kacey, quietly now. All of them. Even the ones I didn't know.<br>
--I'm sorry, I say at last.<br>
She doesn't reply.<br>
--Kacey, I'm sorry, I say again.<br>
But the El train is going by now, and I don't know if my sister can hear me.

--I told you, says Kacey. I knew when he found out that Eddie Lafferty might be the one killing those women, he wouldn't stand for it. I know him.<br>
I shake my head. I notice, suddenly, that Kacey looks unsteady and pale. She has her hands on her stomach. She is six months pregnant, now, and seems to feel it. I don't know if she'll make it the whole way. She keeps insisting she's fine, but she's bent forward slightly. How long has it been, I wonder, since her last dose of methadone?<br>
--Are you okay? I ask her.<br>
--Fine, Kacey says, tightly.<br>
We walk in silence a little longer. Then she goes on.<br>
--Connor can do bad things, Kacey says, but he's not all bad. Almost nobody is.<br>
I have nothing to say to this. I picture Mrs. Mahon, her hand tipping back and forth in the air above the chessboard. They're bad and good both, all the pieces. It is possible to acknowledge, on some level, the truth of this. And yet I hate Connor McClatchie for what he did to my sister. And I know, without a doubt, that I'll never forgive him.

Then she kicked him once more in the face, and he was out.

V(Evey): "Give me a viking funeral," you said. That isn't much. That isn't much to ask. Not after all you did. You came out of an abattoir unharmed, but not unchanged. And saw freedom's necessity; not just for you, but for us all. You saw, and seeing, dared to do. How purposeful was your vendetta, how benign, almost like surgery. Your foes assumed you sought revenge upon their flesh alone, but you did not stop there. You gored their ideology as well. The people stand within the ruins of society, a jail intended to outlive them all. The door is open. They can leave, or fall instead to squabbling and thence new slaveries. The choice is theirs, as ever it must be. I will not lead them, but I'll help them build. Help them create where I'll not help them kill. The age of killers is no more. They have no place within our better world. "Give me a viking funeral," you said. It's yours, my love... it's yours.

V(Evey): Good evening, London. I would introduce myself, but truth to tell, I do not have a name. You can call me "V." Since mankind's dawn, a handful of oppressors have accepted the responsibility over our lives that we should have accepted for ourselves. By doing so, they took our power. By doing nothing, we gave it away. We've seen where their way leads, through camps and wars, towards the slaughterhouse. In anarchy, there is another way. With anarchy, from rubble comes new life, hope reinstated. They say anarchy's dead, but see... reports of my death were exaggerated. Tomorrow, Downing Street will be destroyed, the head reduced to ruins, an end to what has gone before. Tonight, you must choose what comes next. Lives of our own, or a return to chains. Choose carefully. And so, adieu.

Finch(main detective): People need symbols, Dominic. He understood that, we've forgotten it. Those people outside lost families during the war. We've kept the lid on their bitterness for years, but we haven't helped them deal with it. Maybe he didn't either, but he certainly took the lid off... just like Larkhill did for me. Everything's different now, Dominic. I don't belong here anymore.<br>
Dominic: You're going? Mr. Finch, listen, it's the drugs...<br>
Finch: Susan's dead, with Creedy and Heyer dividing his carcass. They're not hallucinations. Neither was the war. I lost my family, and thought following orders could heal that. It can't.

V: First, you must discover whose face lies behind this mask, but you must never know my face. Is that quite clear?<br>
Evey (inner thoughts): No. No, it isn't clear at all. V, you wouldn't die and leave me in all this confusion, so you can't be dead. That's all there is to it. I'm going to walk up these stairs and through that door and you'll be alive and it will be just another mean trick, another part of my education. No hanging back. Straight up the stairs, straight through the door, and... So. Dead then. Oh christ, what happens next? You never said. You never said what you were educating me for. You never told me what I'm supposed to do. All right. All right, then, what I do is this: I walk towards the body, very quietly, very reverently... and I stoop down, my fingers struggle clumsily with elasticated straps... and then I take off the mask...No. No, that isn't what I do. What I do is, in tears I stumble over to the corpse. It's slippery with blood beneath my fingers, but I tear the mask aside, and... No. No. That's not it. Because you were so big, V, and what if you're just nobody? Or even if you're someone, you'll be smaller, cause of all the people that you could have been but weren't. Oh, I don't know. I don't know what I mean. Just do it. There's no reason why I shouldn't. No one here to stop me. I'll just walk across the floor and take hold of the mask, and... No. No, I'm past that one. You weren't my dad. I know that. Even if you were, it wouldn't be enough. If I take off that mask, something will go away forever, be diminished because whoever you are isn't as big as the idea of you, but... but... you said I had to, that I had to know... so I start walking towards the body, trying not to tread in all the blood. It doesn't move. It doesn't look much like a person anymore. Something has gone from it. I kneel, my hands are trembling, I can hardly find the fastenings, but finally I lift away that maddening smile, and... [a mask looking like Evey]... and at last I know. I know who V must be.

Evey: Are these rooms connected?<br>
V: Everything is connected. You must understand that knowledge is not all your heritage. It includes also courage and belief, like hers that we commemorate herein... and romance. Always, always romance. Midst insurrection's clamour, we may easily forget just what it is for which we strive. Isn't it dancing? Scented shoulders? Pupils widened by desire or wine? Anarchy must embrace the din of bombs and cannon-fire... yet always must it love sweet music more...<br>
V: Unlike t.v, we cannot have too much of science, despite its nuclear quirks. With science, ideas can germinate within a bed of theory, form, and practice that assists their growth... but we, as gardeners, must beware... for some seeds are the seeds of ruin... and the most iridescent blooms are often the most dangerous.<br>
V: Anarchy wears two faces, both creator and destroyer. Thus destroyers topple empires; make a canvas of clean rubble where creators can then build a better world. Rubble, once achieved, makes further ruins means irrelevant. Away with our explosives, then! Away with our destroyers! They have no place within our better world.

V: Don't you? Your lover lived in the penitentiary that we are all born into, and was forced to rake the drecs of that world for his living. He knew affection and tenderness but only briefly. Eventually, one of the other inmates stabbed him with a cutlass and he drowned upon his own blood. Is that it, Evey? Is that the happiness worth more than freedom?<br>
Evey: How did you know? How did you know what happened to Gordon?<br>

V: That's because you're afraid, Evey. You're afraid because you can feel freedom closing in upon you. You're afraid because freedom is terrifying.<br>
Evey: I can't feel anything! There's nothing to feel! Leave me alone!<br>
V: Don't back away from it, Evey. Part of you understands the truth even as part pretends not to. Woman, this is the most important moment of your life. Don't run from it.<br>

I wanted to be an actress. I met my first girlfriend at school. Her name was Sara. She was fourteen and I was fifteen but we were both in miss Watson's class. Her wrists. Her wrists were beautiful. I sat in biology class, staring at the pickled rabbit fetus in its jar, listening while Mr. Hird said it was an adolescent phase that people outgrew... Sara did. I didn't. In 1976 I stopped pretending and took a girl called Christine home to meet my parents. A week later, I moved to London, enrolling at drama college. My mother said I broke her heart... but it was my integrity that was important. Is that so selfish? It sells for so little, but it's all we have left in this place. It is the very last inch of us... but within that inch we are free!<br>
Captain: Alright. Now, Miss Hammond, let's review the facts. You work for codename V. Codename V kills security officers. Peter Creedy is a security officer. He frequents the Kitty Kat Keller. You were found outside the establishment with a loaded gun. You were planning to murder Mr. Creedy, under the orders of codename V. Isn't that what happened, Miss Hammond?<br>
Evey: No! No, please that isn't true...<br>
Captain: Oh dear Rossiter.
Rossiter: Sir.
Evey: No! Wait! Please don't. (Evey gets waterboarded.)<br>
Valerie: London, I was happy in London... I saw a lot of the scene, but I never felt comfortable there. So many of them just wanted to be gay, it was their life, their ambition, all they talked about. No! I wanted more than that. Work improved. I got small film roles, then bigger ones. In 1986 I starred in the Salt Flats! It pulled in the awards but not the crowds. I met Ruth while working on that. We loved each other. We lived together, and on Valentine's day she sent me roses, and oh God, we had so much. Those were the best three years of my life. In 1988 there was the war and after that there were no more roses. Not for anybody. In 1992, after the take-over, they started rounding up the gays. They took Ruth while she was out looking for food. Why are they so frightened of us? They burned her with cigarette ends and made her give them my name. She signed a statement saying I'd seduced her. I didn't blame her. God. I loved her. I didn't blame her. But she did. She killed herself in her cell. She couldn't live with betraying me, with giving up that last inch. Oh Ruth. They came for me. They told me that all my films would be burned. They shaved off my hair. They held my head down a toilet bowl and told jokes about lesbians. They brought me here and gave me drugs. I can't feel my tongue anymore. I can't speak. The other gay woman here, Rita, died two weeks ago. I imagine I'll die quite soon. It is strange that my life should end in such a terrible place, but for three years I had roses and I apologised to nobody. I shall die here, every inch of me shall perish... except one. An inch. It's small and it's fragile and it's the only thing in the world that's worth having. We must never lose it, or sell it, or give it away. We must never let them take it from us. I don't know who you are, or whether you're a man or woman. I may never see you. I will never hug you or cry with you or get drunk with you. But I love you. I hope that you escape this place. I hope that the world turns and that things get better, and that one day people have roses again. I wish I could kiss you.<br>
Captain: "My name is Eve Hammond. On the fifth of November, 1997, I was abducted by the terrorist known as codename 'V' and then taken against my will to an unknown location. Once there, I was systematically brainwashed by means of drugs and torture, both physical and psychological. I was frequently subjected to sexual abuse during this period. Eventually, I was terrorized into helping him commit murders. These included the unlawful killings of Mr. Roger Dascombe, Mr. Derek Almond, Dr. Delia Surridge and the Reverend Anthony Lilliman, bishop of Westminster. I also undertook the attempted murder of Mr. Peter Creedy. I, the undersigned, swear that the above statement is genuine, and that it was not signed by means of intimidation." We'd like you sign that for us, Miss Hammond. Where we've put the little cross...<br>
Evey: No.<br>
Captain: As you wish. Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell Rossiter, where she will wait while you arrange a wet detail of six men...then take her out behind the chemical sheds and shoot her.<br>
Rossiter: It's time... unless you want to change your mind. Sign that statement. You could be out inside three years. Perhaps they'd find you a job with the Finger. A lot of your sort get work with the Finger.<br>
Evey: Thank you... but I'd rather die behind the chemical sheds.<br>
Rossiter: Then there's nothing left to threaten with, is there? You are free.<br>
Evey: What?

From V For Vendatta<br>
V: I suppose you're wondering why I've called you here this evening. Well, you see, I'm not entirely satisfied with your performance lately... I'm afraid your work's been slipping, and... well, I'm afraid we've been thinking about letting you go. Oh, I know, I know. You've been with the company a long time now. Almost... let me see. Almost ten thousand years! My word, doesn't time fly? It seems like only yesterday... I remember the day you commenced your employment, swinging down from the trees, fresh-faced and nervous, a bone clasped in your bristling fist... "Where do I start, sir?" you asked, plaintively. I recall my exact words: "There's a pile of dinosaur eggs over there, youngster," I said, smiling paternally the while. Well, we've certainly come a long way since then, haven't we? And yes, yes, you're right, in all that time you haven't missed a day.Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Also, please don't think I've forgotten about your outstanding service record, or about all of the invaluable contributions that you've made to the company... fire, the wheel, agriculture... it's an impressive list, old-timer. A jolly impressive list. Don't get me wrong. But... well, to be frank, we've had our problems too. There's no getting away from it. Do you know what I think a lot of it stems from? I'll tell you... it's your basic unwillingness to get on within the company. You don't seem to want to face up to any real responsibility, or to be your own boss. Lord knows, you've been given plenty of opportunities... we've offered you promotion time and time again, and each time you've turned us down. "I couldn't handle the work, guv'nor," you wheedled. "I know my place." To be frank, you're not trying, are you? You see, you've been standing still for far too long. And it's starting to show in your work... and, I might add, in your general standard of behavior. The constant bickering on the factory floor has not escaped my attention... nor the recent bouts of rowdiness in the staff canteen. Then of course there's... hmm. Well, I didn't really want to have to bring this up, but... well, you see, I've been hearing some disturbing rumors about your personal life. No, never you mind who told me. No names, no pack drill... I understand that you are unable to get on with your spouse. I hear that you argue. I am told that you shout. Violence has been mentioned. I am reliably informed that you always hurt the one you love... the one you shouldn't hurt at all. And what about the children? It's always the children who suffer, as you're well aware. Poor little mites. What are they to make of it? What are they to make of your bullying, your despair, your cowardice and all your fondly nurtured bigotries? Really, it's not good enough, is it? And it's no good blaming the drop in work standards upon bad management, either... though, to be sure, the management is very bad. In fact, let us not mince words... the management is terrible! We've had a string of embezzlers, frauds, liars and lunatics making a string of catastrophic decisions. This is plain fact. But who elected them? It was you! You who appointed these people! You who gave them the power to make your decisions for you! While I'll admit that anyone can make a mistake once, to go on making the same lethal errors century after century seems to me nothing short of deliberate. You have encouraged these malicious incompetents, who have made your working life a shambles. You have accepted without question their senseless orders. You have allowed them to fill your workspace with dangerous and unproved machines. You could have stopped them. All you had to say was "No." You have no spine. You have no pride. You are no longer an asset to the company. I will, however, be generous. You will be granted two years to show me some improvement in your work. If at the end of that time you are still unwilling to make a go of it... you're fired. That will be all. You may return to your labours.

Dr. Delia: When I saw you that night... the night you escaped. You were standing against the flames. You turned and you looked straight at me. I knew then that one day you'd come looking for me, that you'd find me. What... what we did, what I did at Larkhill... that terrible knowledge. It's been with me for so long. That I could do things like that. I heard of an experiment once, one the Americans did. They had volunteers working a shock generator. The volunteers were told that it was wired to a patient in an adjoining room... it wasn't. There was only an actor, whose voice could be heard through the intercom. The volunteers were instructed by a doctor to start administering electric shocks. They were told to gradually increase the voltage. The "victim" began begging them to stop. They were told to increase it again. This time the victim started screaming. After a while the screams were choked off to be replaced by silence. The volunteers were told to increase the voltage once more... nearly 80% of those tested carried on administering shocks after the "victim" begged them to stop. Nearly 60% continued even after they believed that they'd killed him. They were ordinary people, and they were prepared to torture a stranger to death just because they were told to by someone in authority. Some of them said they'd even enjoyed it. I think I enjoyed what I did at the time. People are stupid and evil. There's something wrong with us... some hideous flaw.

From V For Vendatta<br>
Evey: There were riots, and people with guns. Nobody knew what was going on. Everyone was waiting for the government to do something...but there wasn't any government anymore. Just lots of little gangs. All trying to take over. And then in 1992, somebody finally did... it was all the fascist groups, the right-wingers. They'd all got together with some of the big corporations that had survived. 'Nosefire' they called themselves. I remember when they marched into London. They had a flag with their symbol on. Everyone was cheering. I thought they were scary. They soon got things under control. But then they started taking people away... all the black people and the Pakistanis... white people, too. All the radicals and the men who, you know, liked other men. The homosexuals. I don't know what they did with them all. Dad had been in a socialist group when he was younger. They came for him one September morning in 1993... it was my birthday, I was twelve. I never saw him again. They made me go and work in a factory with a lof of other kids. We were putting matches into boxes. I lived in  a hostel. It was cold and dirty and I just used to cry all the time. I wanted my dad. That's how it was for four years... not enough food, not enough money. Some of the older girls made money going with men. That's what I was going to do. Last night. But they were Fingermen. They were going... they were g-going to... they were going to ruh... ruh... ruh...<br>
V: Hush child, hush. It's over now. You're safe. The past can't hurt you anymore. Not unless you let it. They made you into a victim, Evey. They made you into a statistic. But that's not the real you. That's not who you are inside. Just trust me, Evey, and we can wipe it all away. All the pain. All the cruelty. All the bereavement. We can start again.

Dad: It's okay that you don't know your major. Truth is you can learn anything through Youtube. Youtube and practice. It's not that mysterious.<br>
Pablo: Easy for you to say. You have an engineering degree from Priceton.<br>
Dad: I didn't love engineering. I liked studying, but that was it. Tell me, do you love anything? Do you enjoy doing anything for the sake of doing it? Life isn't a destination. It's the continual practice of things that make you wiser and happier. Someday I hope to make perfect sourdough bread. I want to learn the piano. I've made peace with the fact that I won't ever make a lot of money, but I make enough to live and eat. The rest goes to your mother. I know you boys think the way I live is depressing or strange, but in art the purporse is in the creation, not the result. Grow as you build. Autotelism. 'Auto' for self and 'telo' for goal. Find joy in the learning, Pablo, not in what it will get you. It took me so much searching to stop searching. Art is fueled by longing but you must learn to want what you have, not get what you want. It's the only way to stop suffering. I pray that you'll know this meaning by the time you're my age.

Christina(astronaut): Definitely, I think it's all about how you frame it and your attitude. Just like now with what we're going through, for me, one of the tricks was to put the right thing on repeat in my head so if I found myself putting on repeat in my head "man, I sure wish I could just have a latte" or something ridiculous like that, I would replace it with what I have now that is unique and that I could never have again: "Wow, I'm really gonna be bummed out when I can't look at these auroras from space anymore.""

Morpheus: The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around. What do you see? Business men, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it. Were you listening to me Neo, or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?<br>
Morpheus: Sentient programs. They can move in and out of any software still hard wired to their system. That means that anyone we haven't unplugged is potentially an agent. Inside the Matrix, they are everyone and they are no one. We are survived by hiding from them, by running from them. But they are the gatekeepers. They are guarding all the doors. They are holding all the keys, which means that sooner or later, someone is going to have to fight them.<br>

Neo: I can't go back, can I?<br>
Morpheus: No. But if you could, would you really want to? I feel I owe you an apology. We have a rule. We never free a mind once it's reached a certain age. It's dangerous, the mind has trouble letting go. I've seen it before and I'm sorry. I did what I did because...I had to. When the Matrix was first built, there was a man born inside who had the ability to change whatever he wanted, to remake the Matrix as he saw fit. It was he who freed the first of us, taught us the truth. As long as the Matrix exists the human race will never be free. After he died the Oracle prophesied his return and that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix and the war, bring freedom to our people. That is why there are those of us who have spent our entire lives searching the Matrix looking for him. I did what I did because I believe that search is over.... Get some rest, you're going to need it.<br>

Morpheus: Your training.

From The Matrix<br>
Neo: This...this isn't real?<br>
Morpheus: What is real? How do you define real? If you’re talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. This is the world that you know. The world as it was at the end of the twentieth century. It exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation that we call the Matrix. You've been living in a dream world, Neo. This is the world as it exists today.... Welcome to the Desert of the Real. We have only bits and pieces of information but what we know for certain is that at some point in the early twenty-first century all of mankind was united in celebration. We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to AI.<br>
Neo: AI? You mean artificial intelligence?<br>
Morpheus: A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. We don't know who struck first, us or them. But we know that it was us that scorched the sky. At the time they were dependent on solar power and it was believed that they would be unable to survive without an energy source as abundant as the sun. Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate it seems is not without a sense of irony. The human body generates more bio-electricity than a 120-volt battery and over 25,000 BTU's of body heat. Combined with a form of fusion the machines have found all the energy they would ever need. There are fields, endless fields, where human beings are no longer born, we are grown. For the longest time I wouldn't believe it, and then I saw the fields with my own eyes. Watch them liquefy the dead so they could be fed intravenously to the living. And standing there, facing the pure horrifying precision, I came to realize the obviousness of the truth. What is the Matrix? Control. The Matrix is a computer generated dream world built to keep us under control in order to change a human being into this.<br>
Neo: No. I don't believe it. It's not possible.<br>
Morpheus: I didn't say it would be easy, Neo. I just said it would be the truth.<br>
Neo: Stop. Let me out. Let me out. I want out.

Morpheus: Welcome to the real world. We've done it, Trinity. We've found him.<br>
Trinity: I hope you're right.<br>
Morpheus: I don't have to hope. I know it.<br>
Neo: Am I dead?<br>
Morpheus: Far from it.

Morpheus: At last. Welcome, Neo. As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.<br>
Neo: It's an honor to meet you.<br>
Morpheus: No, the honor is mine. Please, come. Sit down. I imagine that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole? Hm?<br>
Neo: You could say that.<br>
Morpheus: I can see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up. Ironically, this is not far from the truth. Do you believe in fate, Neo?<br>
Neo: No.<br>
Morpheus: Why not?<br>
Neo: Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.<br>
Morpheus: I know exactly what you mean. Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you know you can't explain. But you feel it. You've felt it your entire life. That there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is but it's there, like a splinter in your mind driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about?<br>
Neo: The Matrix?<br>
Morpheus: Do you want to know what IT is? The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us, even now in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.<br>
Neo: What truth?<br>
Morpheus: That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage, born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your mind.... Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. This is your last chance. After this there is no turning back. You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.... Remember, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.

Switch: Stop the car. Listen to me, Copper-top. We don't have time for twenty questions. Right now there's only one rule, our way or the highway.<br>
Neo: Fine.<br>
Trinity: Please, Neo. You have to trust me.<br>
Neo: Why?<br>
Trinity: Because you have been down there, Neo. You know that road. You know exactly where it ends. And I know that's not where you want to be.

From The Matrix<br>
(Interrogation)<br>
Agent Smith: As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson. It seems that you've been living two lives. In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company, you have a social security number, you pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias Neo and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not. I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson. You're here because we need your help. We know that you've been contacted by a certain individual, a man who calls himself Morpheus. Now whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant. He is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive. My colleagues believe that I am wasting my time with you but I believe that you wish to do the right thing. We're willing to wipe the slate clean, give you a fresh start and all that we're asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.<br>
Neo: Yeah. Wow, that sound like a really good deal. But I think I got a better one. How about I give you the finger... and you give me my phone call.

(Office)<br>
Mr. Rhineheart: You have a problem with authority, Mr. Anderson. You believe that you are special, that somehow the rules do not apply to you. Obviously you are mistaken. This company is one of the top software companies in the world because every single employee understands that they are part of a whole. Thus if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem. The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson. Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forward or you choose to find yourself another job. Do I make myself clear?<br>
Neo: Yes, Mr. Rhineheart, perfectly clear.

Trinity: Please just listen. I know why you're here, Neo. I know what you've been doing. I know why you hardly sleep, why you live alone, and why night after night you sit at your computer. You're looking for him. I know, because I was once looking for the same thing. And when he found me, he told me I wasn't really looking for him. I was looking for an answer. It's the question that drives us mad. It's the question that brought you here. You know the question just as I did.<br>
Neo: What is the Matrix?<br>
Trinity: The answer is out there, Neo. It's looking for you. And it will find you, if you want it to.
