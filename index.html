From This Movie Changed Me Star Wars: A New Hope<br>
Mr. Greene: Yep, I mean it’s just disgusting. Everyone is different and weird and wonderful... And I have loved bars ever since then because of the weird characters. And a bar is a really special place. You walk in, and you feel uncomfortable. You feel a little out of place in the very beginning... Really vulnerable, as we saw with Luke: He almost got killed, and he needed Obi-Wan to save him... Just because they didn’t like what he looked like — which was great, wasn’t it? Because he’s probably, objectively, the best-looking person in that bar with a bunch of weird-looking aliens — and he’s the one who is different. And that was not lost on me either... Right, exactly, which is kind of beautiful. But the whole relationship with a bar is, how quickly does that kind of discomfort go away? How quickly can you make a connection and begin to feel comfortable? And that’s the whole narrative and cool thing about a bar. It’s a place that’s always open, or almost always open, and it’s almost a friend. And you’re gonna meet wacky characters who are completely different. You’re gonna be exposed to people, or aliens, who you’d never come in contact with elsewhere.<br>
Ms. Percy: Exactly, yeah. It’s kind of like an equalizer. I know there are classy bars and dive bars, but I feel like it’s a place where you meet all kinds of people — different backgrounds, some people with money, some people with no money. Everyone’s there just to be with someone else. It’s kind of that idea of being alone, together.<br>
... Mr. Greene:
And you could go there — there could be someone who was homeless and was trying to find just a place to stay warm and get a cup of coffee. There could be a hipster. There could be a poet. There could be a college professor. There could be someone who had gotten back from a Red Sox game and was just wasted. And it was just this collection of people from all walks of life. I remember whenever I went in there, I was always reminded of the Star Wars scene, because it was exactly like that — at a human level, but it was exactly like that.

Greene: From the moment that Princess Leia confronted Darth Vader on that ship, she showed not an ounce of fear...Her face, it is stoic. It is like, “Only you would be so bold.” ... And she is standing there, ready to confront him. And he could’ve pulled out a light saber and destroyed her in a second flat, and she knows that. And she was absolutely fearless. And I think it really drove home the power of a strong woman. And I knew that, because I was raised by one. But throughout the movie I remember just being enchanted by that.

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
Acknowledgments: ...to my editor, Jordan Pavlin, for having confidence in this novel when it was just a phrase in my mind.<br>
...And finally to my husband, Pierre, whose central role in this project goes back to a lunch on our deck one summer day. It was about a year after our first river trip, and I was still obsessed. Since I was writing The Abortionist's Daughter at the time, I was trying to turn one of the characters into a river guide. Suffice it to say that I had trouble figuring out how a river guide would end up a criminal detective, and sought Pierre's help. We brainstormed for an hour.<br>
"Give it up," he finally said. "Go write a whole novel about the river."<br>
So I did.

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
Acknowledgments: This book never would have happened if I hadn't fallen out of the boat... during my first Grand Canyon trip. Which might seem odd, given the fact that my so-called swim lasted for just thirty terrifying seconds. But with the terror came an exhilaration I hadn't felt for ages, and before I even dried out, I was already writing about it. I wouldn't know there was a novel here until much, much later, but the experience has fueled most of my writing since that day.<br>
...As the boat reared up, I topped over the back; Ed grabbed onto my ankle for the briefest of seconds, then let me go, physically and spiritually, down into the deep... I was sucked down and spun around and finally ejected back into the sunlight, after which I truly felt like an unexpected rebirth had taken place.<br>
...That first trip jump-started a continuing passion for the river... May you all continue to welcome other travelers into the magical world below the rim.<br>
...Some people may not have realized they played such an important role in this project, and I wish to extend my gratitude to them... my beloved parents... for all those trips in the red canoe, which despite its unfortunate disappearance is out there on some lake or stream, making someone happy.<br>

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
The road out of the canyon at Diamond Creek is steep, rocky, and deeply rutted from flash floods... the bumps and jolts can take their roll on a person's joints.<br>
...JT had a pretty standard speech, but this had not exactly been a standard trip.<br>
...Abo: How much of this trip are you going to write up, when you make your trip report?<br>
JT: the whole truth. Nothing but the truth.<br>
...Abo: Well now, I LEARN from my mistakes! ... Let's do another trip together!<br>
Dixie: Maybe next year.<br>
...JT found himself looking straight down into the dry canyon bed.<br>
A shadow. Moving.<br>
"Hey. Stop the truck," JT said.<br>
"I can't stop," said the driver. "I'll never get going again."<br>
"Stop the truck," said JT... When the dust cleared, he looked down, thinking he'd imagined it.<br>
...Abo: What is it? What do you see?<br>
JT strained his eyes to make sure. How the fuck?<br>
Dixie poked her head out of the window. "What is it?"<br>
JT shook his head in wonder.<br>
"You damn dog," he breathed. [He saw Blender, the missing dog.]
	</p>


	<p id="1481">
From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
"It doesn't mean anything either way [speaking about how Blender, the dog, might be dead]," said JT. "I don't think anyone should jump to conclusions. On the other hand, I guess we're just not going to know anything for sure."<br>
...It was Sam who noticed that Mitchell had disappeared. They looked around and finally saw his floppy tan hat bobbing through the tall thickets along the bank downriver.<br>
Then his head vanished, and in another moment they heard the terrible sound of retching. Under other circumstances, there would be speculation of a stomach virus, or too much to drink the night before, or gluttony at the lunch table. Not today.<br>
Sam headed toward the thicket.<br>
"Give him some space, Sam," Mark called.<br>
But Sam kept going, in search of the man who was most in need of comfort.

And that would be it. Trip over. Finito.<br>
JT laced his fingers beneath his head. Ordinarily he was always looking forward to the next trip: a few days off, then the mass load-up again, a new list of passengers, introductions, and lessons about the basics of life on the river. Ordinarily he didn't let himself get too sentimental at Diamond Creek, knowing the river would always be there, knowing that he would always be back.<br>
But a large part of him was feeling way too fragile on this trip. He was afraid to say good-bye to these people, for reasons he couldn't explain. In the middle of the night, he woek up with a start. His heart was pounding. And a new thought came to him: he was a fraud. Who was he, to think that he could guide people down the river? Oh, he knew the water, he knew the hikes, he knew enough stories and history to write a book. But in the end, he was just a guy who loved the river, who made a pact with the stars every night, who woke up every morning with the current tugging at his soul. For people like him, going down the river wasn't just going down the river. It was something so much grander, a journey into a simpler time of a simpler soul, and JT suddenly had the feeling that in taking poeple down the river, he broke something in them, something that perhaps needed breaking but needed reconstruction as well; and while he was good at the breaking part, good at taking them to the other side of hcaos, he felt like he gave them nothing with which to reconstruct themselves after the journey.<br>
Fraud with a wrecking ball.

Peter: I just wanted to say thank you.<br>
Dixie: Don't mention it. It's been quite the trip, hasn't it?<br>
"I don't mean it like that, althought thanks for that too," Peter said. "What I mean is, well, maybe you noticed and maybe you didn't, but I've had a crush on you the whole trip. I think you're one of the most beautiful women I've ever known. And you're a river guide! I was a goner as soon as JT introduced you to us all, back up to Lee's Ferry."<br>
Dixie sat down.<br>
"But I'm not telling you this for the reason you might think. I know you have a boyfriend down in Tucson. I know we're going to say goodbye tomorrow, and I'll probably never see you again. But I just wanted to say thank you, for letting me be in love with you for two weeks."<br>
Dixie fingered the twisted wire horse at her throat.<br>
"That's all," said Peter.

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
Everyone had a theory about the dog.<br>
Evelyn was sure he was dead. She recalled Lava Falls, and how much water there was. Authomatically she computed numerous factors in her head--volume, body weight, time, and temperature--and knew there was simply no way the dog could have survived.<br>
Jill thought he was dead too. Not by any calculation of the odds, but bbecause of her ingrained belief--despite this river trip--in her own personal Murphy's Law: if something could p;ossibly come along to make her boys forever happy, it wouldn't. She began to regreat not letting the boys get a dog earlier--perhaps if they already had a dog, they wouldn't have grown up so attached to Blender. She wondered how much grieving time she should allow before suggesting they visit the animal shelter in Salt Lake City.<br>
Mark, on the other hand, was convinced the dog had survived, that it was only a matter of time before he caught up with them.<br>
"That dog has nine lives," he declared, right in front of the boys, which made Jill wince for all its false hope. At the same time, she envied his optimism.<br>
Please, just don't let us find a body, she thought.<br>
Ruth, who had buried a yardful of pets, was more philosophical. Perhaps because she had seen so many animals come and go; perhaps because hse knew it was, after all, just a dog, and at the moment other things--childbirth and degenerative illnesses, to name a few--seemed more compelling. And Lloyd had already forgotten completely about the dog; he couldn't understand what the fuss was all about. "Dogs aren't even allowed down here," he kept reminding people, implying that fourteen people had hallucinated Blender's existence.<br>
For his part, Mitchell was racked with guilt, and he retreated into morose silence. He kept revisiting the rum through Lava. Just when had he let go of the dog? Was it in the V-wave or below? He sat in the hot sun in the back of JT's boat and stared at his hands, trying to understand how they had released their grip. And why hadn't he clamped his thighs around the dog more tightly? Why didn't they think of tying him to one of the lines, for that matter? There were a thousand decisions that Mitchell, in anguished hindsight, would have made differently.<br>
...Mark's son, Sam: So we might find [Blender] when we get back to Flagstaff?<br>
Mark: We might. I don't want you to get your hopes up, though.<br>
"I won't, Dad. Can I leave my light on?"<br>
"Sure," said Mark, and when he bent down to kiss his son good night, Sam wrapped his arms around his neck and didn't let go for a long time.<br>
"I hate to give him false hopes," Jill said when Mark came to lie down beside her.<br>
"What would you tell him?"<br>
Jill thought for a moment, then sighed. "I guess I'd tell him the same thing." She felt across the sand for Mark's hand and laced her fingers with his. "But I'd try not to feed things."<br>
"I don't think I have," said Mark.<br>
"No. I don't think you have, either. You're pretty sensitive to nuance."<br>
"You think?"<br>
"Yes, I do," she whispered.<br>
"Thanks," he whispered back. "You know, I really do think he's alive."<br>
"Keep thinking that, then," she said, squeezing his hand.

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
"You know, I wonder," [Amy's] mother began, and Amy thought, Here it comes:<br>
Who's the father [of the baby]?<br>
How did this happen?<br>
Didn't you notice your periods stopping?<br>
And what are you going to do with it?<br>
But instead, her mother said, "I wonder if they have a whirlpoo. They had a whirlpool in the hospital where I had you. I think I'll go check. I'll be right back."<br>
No, stay, Amy wanted to say, but her mother was already out of the room.<br>
... she stuck her giant nipple in between [the baby's] lips, but he made funny breathing noises, and she was afraid she would suffocate him, so she held him up and he began to cry, and she began to cry, and her breasts felt prickly all over, and she wished her mother had not lfet the room, and she wanted to go back to yesterday, the day before Lava, when she was not a mother, she was not pregnant, there was no baby, it was just a stomach problem, annoying but temporary.<br>
She heard the swish of Kleenex and opened her eyes. Her mother was standing by her bedside, and Amy saw the saddest thing she'd ever seen in her life:  the sight of her mother crying. Which made Amy cry even more.<br>
..."Why should I nurse him if I'm not going to keep him?"<br>
"Because it's goo dfor him," said Susan.<br>
"If it's good for him, then I should keep doing it, which means I shouldn't give him up. And if I keep nursing him, I won't be able to give him up. I'll want to keep him even more."<br>
"Shhh," and Susan handed Amy another Kleenex... "All these things will fall into place," she said. "There's no rush to decide."<br>
"I don't know who the father is," Amy whispered.<br>
"That's all right."<br>
"No. It's not."<br>
"Do you want to tell me about it?"<br>
"No. Because that means I'll remember more than I want to remember."<br>
But it was already there, whether she wanted to remember it or not.<br>
"I won't flip out," Susan said. "I promise."<br>
"Yes you will." And it suddenly hurt Amy, to think of how much it was going to hurt her mother, to hear what had happened.<br>
"Amy," said Ssuan..."I just helped you deliver a baby. My mind's already imagining the worst. You might as well tell me."<br>
"About how I got drunk? You realize I probably don't have all the details, because of that."<br>
"Believe me, honey. I probably don't want all the details."<br>
...[Amy] was grateful that her mother was standing behind her. "So last Halloween?"<br>
"Okay," Susan said, "okay," and her voice sounded guarded, and Amy wished she hadn't begun the story but knew there was no way to stop at this point.<br>
"I wasn't even going out that night. I was going to stay home and hand out candy. But then you got dressed up as Pippi Longstocking."<br>
..."I liked that costume!"<br>
"Excpet you wanted me to dress up too. You had a Little Orphan Annie wig you wanted me to wear."<br>
"I did?"<br>
"Yes, you did."<br>
...And so Amy had left the ouse and gone to a coffe shop, where she ordered a hot chocolate and read a chapter in Walden. Around ten, some guys came in; one of them was in her math class. And they must have taken pity on her because they asked what she was doing there alone, and she said she was reading ahead for lit class, and that's when they joked about kitnapping her.<br>
People didn't usually joke with her, and it made her feel cool. She didn't say that out loud to her mother.<br>
"So we went to a park," she went on. "They had vodka. They weren't trying to be mean; they just figured I knew how to drink."<br>
"How much did you drink?"<br>
"Like I'd know?"<br>
"Do you remember calling and telling me you were staying at Sarah's?"<br>
"Is that what I told you?"<br>
"You did. And I believed it."<br>
"Sorry."<br>
"That's okay. It's not like I never lied to my parents."<br>
Things got even fuzzier after that. She remembered being in the backseat of someone's car and people helping her walk into a house. She remembered the scratchy carpet against her face, and some girls helping her to her feet and taking her into the bedroom, where there was a king-sized bed piled with coats. She woke up in darkness with a cottony mouth and cold feet. Her pants lay on the floor; her legs were damp and sticky, and her underwear was on backward.<br>
She had the sense there'd been more than one.<br>
She told all this to her mother, except the part about the underwear. And the number. Which she really didn't know. It was just plural.<br>
... At home she took a shower, and everything stung, and yes, it occurred to her, but only fleetingly, and she put it out of her head because there were more pressing things to think about, such as college visits during the winter and SATs and AP exams in the spring.<br>
"Didn't you feel yourself gaining weight?" Susan asked.<br>
"I'm always gaining weight."<br>
"But didn't it feel different?"<br>
"No. Yes. I don't know."<br>
..."And those girls didn't stay to help you?" Susan said suddenly. "Didn't they know they shouldn't leave you alone like that? Whatever happened to the idea of girls looking out for each other?"<br>
"It doesn't work that way, Mom," said Amy.<br>
"I wanto to wring their little necks," said Susan. "I want to wring that boy's neck too."<br>
"Mom. You told me you'd be able to handle it."<br>
"I didn't say I wouldn't get mad, though," said Susan. "It infuriates me. Not just what the boy did to you. Didn't anyone look in on you? You were passed out! You could have choked on your own vomit! What's with these kids?"<br>
Amy shrugged. She'd been the subject of whispery speculation for about a month--until Thanksgiving, actually, when someone else did something dumb and provided new gossip for the high school tabloids.<br>
...[Amy] wanted desperately to comfort her mother right now. I'm alive, she wanted to say. I survived. But she knew her mother's heart was broken, and nothing she could say would help. And she hated herself, for getting drunk that night and doing this to her mother.<br>
"Mom. Stop. I'm all right."<br>
Susan took a deep breath and sat down beside Amy and searched her eyes.<br>
"It isn't easy, hearing this," she said. "But you're right. I promised you I wouldn't flip out. I feel like I'm going to flip out, but I won't. I just need to vent a little. But I'll deal with this. You'll deal with this. It's not going to wreck your life. You're not going to punish yourself forever. We're going to figure out the best solution, and it might not be clear for a couple of days, or even weeks, but we're going to get through this. Remember what JT said? You lose your confidence, you lose everything. My goodness." She sighed. "What if we had never come down the river? What if this had happened back in Mequon? I don't know if I would have been able to get through all this and come out whole. Maybe I would have. But I don't know." She took Amy's face betwwen her hands and shook her own head in a way that meant yes.<br>
"We'll figure it out," she said again.<br>
"Okay," said Amy.<br>
And even Amy thought that particular word, "okay," sounded different, when spoken for once without anger or sarcasm.

"I gave [Lena] the EpiPen," [Mitchell] told them. "She threw up, and she's breathing better. She says her throat doesn't hurt anymore. I'll stay up with her tonight," he told JT. "She'll be fine."<br>
"I'm really sorry this happened," Abo said.<br>
Mitchell shrugged. "We all make mistakes. I've certainly made my share."<br>
JT was so surprised to hear this that he couldn't come up with a gracious response.<br>
"I gotta say," Mitchell went on. "I was so impressed this afternoon watching you guys deal with Amy and all."<br>
"We just called for help," said JT. "The paramedics did everything else."<br>
"But the real hero is Amy, isn't she?" Mitchell said. "I have to hand it to the girl. She really rose to the occasion. Not that she had a choice. But what a trooper. Seventeen years old. I just hope it doesn't get in the way of her college plans."<br>
"Are you going to put this in your book, Mitchell?" Dixie asked.<br>
"No," said Mitchell. "Nobody would believe it. Well, I'm gonig to go sit with Lena. But I really think she's going to be okay."<br>
JT watched Mitchell walk off into the darkness. He thought to himself that if they'd given out awards that night, Mitchell certainly would have earned the award for Most Changed Passenger. Because to go from someone who refused to follow directions and insisted on scaring the shit out of everyone and threatened to sue the guides when things didn't go his way--to go from that to someone who could lift the iron chains off the Trip Leader's shoulders at the end of a really difficult day didn't count for nothing, down here in the ditch.<br>
...[JT] didn't want to let himself think about the fact that the dog wasn't there at his feet, but he couldn't help it. Were the boys hoping for too much? Was he? Because he had to admit that a part of him expected to find the dog tomorrow, alive and well. He knew it was a piss-ass thought and hated himself for having it, but there it was.<br>
...[JT] could be thankful that he hadn't gotten the foot fungus on this trip, at least. He could be thankful that the stomach flue hadn't ripped through camp. He could be thankful that he'd had ten good days with a dog who came out of nowhere.<br>
He had a lot of things to be thankful for, but none of them helped him go to sleep that night.<br>
...There were several false sightings[of the missing dog], and the boys' hopes soared, then plummeted.<br>
"We'll find him," said Mitchell after the third time. "I'm sure we'll find him."<br>
Sam whipped around to face JT and Mitchell. "How do you know?" he demanded. "Why should I believe you? You're the one who let go of him."<br>
"Sam," cautioned JT.<br>
"You didn't like this dog from the start! You wanted to leave him on the beach where we found him! I heartd you say that! You've been trying to get rid of him the whole trip!"<br>
"Come on, Sam," JT warned.<br>
"Sam's right, though," said Matthew, and something in his voice served as a further reminder that they were brothers; that despite the fact that they had been arguing since the day Sam was born, they were, fundamentally, on the same cosmic side of all the things that really mattered. And when it came to a dog and the possibility that some grown man might be responsible for its demise, they were going to stick together.<br>
"Lava was a wild ride," JT reminded them. "I wouldn't go blaming Mitchell for losing the dog."<br>
"But the boys are right," said Mitchell. "I did lose him. He was my responsibility, and I let go. But I didn't mean to. I really didn't mean to."<br>
..."I really didn't," Mitchell told JT.<br>
"I know you didn't, Mitchell."<br>
"But I want them to believe me."<br>
"They will at some point," said JT. "Maybe just not right now."<br>
..."How'd you get to be so patient, JT?" he asked. "Were you born that way?"<br>
"Hundred and twenty-five trips, I guess."<br>
"How do you get to be a guide, anyway?"<br>
"You interested?"<br>
"Only when I'm feeling adventurous. But I wish I'd done this trip when I was a little younger, you know? Before the old body started breaking down."<br>
"You're never too old to start something new," said JT.<br>
"What about you? you going to keep on doing this the rest of your life?"<br>
JT grinned. "Med school, I'm thinking. Obstetrics."<br>
Both men were silent, remembering the strange events of the previous day.<br>
"I gotta hand it to [Amy]," Mitchell said. "She came through with flying colors."<br>
..."What are you going to name this book, anyway?"<br>
"Haven't a clue," said Mitchell.<br>
For the next half hour they floated. The boys kept an optimistic conversation going, convincing each other of the dog's safety. He was wearing his life jacket; he knew hoe to swim; he knew how to take care of himself in the desert. QED: he would show up at the campsite tonight.<br>
JT didn't want to say anything, but he grew less and less hopeful as the morning wore on.<br>
...He felt it his duty to start preparing the boys, but they were busy concocting elaborate theories about the dog's tracking abilities.<br>
..."Dogs are so smart," Sam told Matthew.<br>
"Should we keep his name?"<br>
"We can probably come up with something better, if you want."<br>
"I guess I like Blender."<br>
"I like Blender too."<br>
Matthew kicked at the water. "Mom'll never let him sleep in our bedroom, though."<br>
"Nope."<br>
"We'll have to sneak him in."<br>
"Dad'll help, I bet," said Sam.<br>
"When he's not in Japan."<br>
"He told Mom he's not going to spend so much time in Japan," said Sam.<br>
"That would be cool," said Matthew.

"What are the chances [of finding the lost dog, Blender]?" Jill asked. "Be honest."<br>
"I don't know." [Mark] said.<br>
Jill nodded somberly. "I just want to be prepared," she said. "I just want to know what we might be dealing with if he doesn't show up. The boys haven't had anyone or anything die on them before, and I want to be able to say the right thing."<br>
Mark drew her close. "We don't need to cross that bridge."

Post-Lava Night was usually a time for celebration.<br>
...But tonight, the Post-Lava party never materialized... The bucket of margaritas was well received (Mark declinded, though he filled a mug for Jill); but mostly they were still too overwhelmed by the events of the afternoon to celebrate. At times, some of them wondered if they'd imagined the birth; but then they would look around, and Amy and Susan's absence would erase their doubts. 
	</p>

	<p id="1473">
From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
Susan cradled the baby to her chest and peered down [from the helicopter]. The view was already panoramic, a vast branching tableau of tan and pink and dusty green, with a tiny silver ribbon weaving in and out. It was just like what the Grand Canyon was supposed to look like, and nothing like what it really was, down on the river.<br>
...Then Amy reached out and stroked the baby's cheek, almost as much out of curiosity as anything else. He scowled in her direction, and without giving it m uch thought, she slipped the tip of her little finger into his mouth, and he grew quiet; and Susan glimpsed in Amy's face something that she, Susan, had forgotten: the sudden, wondrous awareness of one's innate maternal magic.<br>
...Below, on the beach, everyone stood in a daze as the helicopter lifted off. Some, like Jill, felt the emotion finally hit them, like delayed thunder. Others recounted to one another their small roles in the birth sequence--Dixie giving Amy her blue sarong, for instance, when she started shivering; Evelyn recording every single contraction in her notebook.

"Where are we?" [Lloyd] asked, looking up. "How did we get here? I'm so confused, Ruthie," he said. "I don't understand any of this."<br>
"Now now," said Ruth. "I'm right here."<br>
"Don't leave me alone like that! I don't know any of these people!"<br>
"There, there," she said, stroking his temple.<br>
From a short distance away, Peter watched the old couple together. It pained him deeply to see Lloyd like this, but at the same time he thought about how lucky they were, to have each other right now. To take this trip, to manage the ins and outs of old age together. And he tried to imagine himself in their shoes, and found it was not as difficult as he might have thought two weeks ago, even if it wasn't Miss Ohio taking his hand and leading him off to sit down and collect himself.

Andy said, "You have to! Just pant!" Peter, who suddenly felt more like part of any team than he'd ever felt in his entire life, relayed this command to Amy and told her again to pant, and he was amazed when she followed his command. Her eyes were wild with fear now, and she seemed completely dependent on his instruction. "Pant!" he kept telling her, over and over, and when this contraction had ended and Amy was still looking terrified, he thought, What an awful, awful thing, to have a baby half in and half out of you!<br>
"It's okay!" he whispered to her. "I think you're almost there."<br>
"One more push, Amy," said Andy.<br>
"Oh!" sobbed Amy. "I can't I can't I can't," but then she drew in the longest, deepest breath she'd yet taken and squeezed so hard that Peter couldn't look at her face for fear that something would pop, and then--just like that--this thing torpedoed out from between her legs, this blue-gray seal with a rubbery corkscrew tail, shooting out so fast that Andy almost failed to catch it. But he did catch it, and the next thing Peter knew, Andy was cradling the waxy limp thing in his hands. It was a boy, and it was still and lifeless, alien and quiet, and what was first and foremost on Peter's mind had nothing to do with the miracle of birth but rather who in this group was going to have the courage to tell Amy that her baby was dead.<br>
..."He's not crying," said Amy.<br>
..."What's happening?" said Amy, looking from Susan to Peter. "Somebody tell me what's happening!"<br>
..."Why isn't he crying?" Peter whispered to Don.<br>
"Like you think I can't hear?" Amy screamed. "Why isn't the baby crying!"<br>
Just then there came a faint trebly sound, a feeble little wail that seemed to string its way from ear to ear among those in the group. And then it came again, louder now, and a cheer erupted. The baby's skin flushed pink, and moments later, with a big smile, Andy reached over and placed him on Amy's stomach.<br>
Amy looked stunned. "Do I touch him?"<br>
Andy laughed. "Of course."

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
JT: Please tell me they're going to be able to get [Amy] out of here before she delivers that baby.<br>
Jill: I wish.<br>
JT: The Flagstaff ER's less than an hour away. That's not very far.<br>
Jill: A lot can happen in an hour.<br>
JT: Don't say that.<br>
Jill: You're the Trip Leader. You have to be prepared.<br>
She was right, of course; he was captain of this voyage. But never had he felt like such a passenger on someone else's boat.<br>
Jill seemed to sense this, because she took his arm and led him away from the tent, toward the water's edge. JT stood where the sand was soft and wet and let his feet sink down into the cold. He wanted to wade in and dunk himself until the water filled his ears and made his head ache, just to drown out the bad thoughts.<br>
"I don't mean this in a disrespectful way, JT," she began, "but I don't think you have any clue what it's like for Amy right now. And it's kind of been a while for me, Sam being twelve and all, but when I was pushing my babies out, if you had told me you were going to load me into a helicopter, I'd have put a gun to your head."<br>
"But it's up to the paramedics, isn't it?"<br>
"In theory," said Jill. "But if I have any vote in the matter, you know where I stand."<br>
The back of his throat felt bitter and dry, and JT found he could not look at Jill any longer. Here was a woman who, twelve days ago, had been but a name on a list, a thirty-eight-year-old mother from Salt Lake City with no allergies and the stated goal of making her boys forget about basketball camp for a few days. Yet now, here, below Lava, on her first trip, she seemed endowed with Solomonic wisdom. And what did that say about him? What had he learned, on 125 trips? How to run Crystal? Anyone with any sense could do it. How to feed large crowds in the wilderness? Read a book. Why, Jill could have done all that, and more--she could have delivered this baby herself if the paramedics hadn't come.<br>
What he'd learned, on all his trips, was how to be alone. And right now, he wasn't even very good at that.<br>
Jill: Are you drinking enough water? Because you don't look so great.<br>
JT repositioned his visor.<br>
"Do you always smile when you're flipping out?"<br>
JT put his hands on his hips. How was it she knew him so well? She held his gaze until he himself broke it and looked out across the river. He felt on the verge of tears, and he wasn't a man to cry. He picked up a rock and threw it in the river and watched the current swallow the rings.<br>
"I've spent half my life on this river," he said. "I've seen heart attacks. I've seen appendicitis. I've seen rattlesnake bites and broken legs with the bone sticking out, and I've even had one guy pull a knife on me. But I've never had anyone go into labor."<br>
"Well, I don't mean to scare you. This baby seems to have a mind of its own, but everything will turn out fine."<br>
"Or not."<br>
"If you're going to be thinking like that, then you should go for a walk."<br>
"I'm not going anywhere," said JT.<br>
"Then calm down," said Jill. "Have a beer if you need it. But shame on you for saying that. We've got a doctor and two paramedics with Amy. Things may go a little faster than we'd hoped, but they won't go wrong. And you can't keep thinking like they will. Because you know what happens if you do?"<br>
"What?"<br>
"When you lose your confidence, you lose everything. You said it yourself."<br>
"I said that?"<br>
"Several times."<br>
JT knew he'd said it, but it sounded far more convincing coming from someone else. Half in jest, he asked if she wanted a job. "pay kinda sucks," he admitted.<br>
"You guys are such bullshit artists."<br>
"I'm not kidding, I can teach you everything," said JT.<br>
"You already have," said Jill.<br>
...Of course, one look at Amy and the paramedics knew they weren't going anywhere. Not until after the baby was born, anyway. They weren't going to move her out of the tent, they weren't going to load her onto a stretcher, they weren't going to risk being in the air when this baby decided to make its entry into the world.

From Logan<br>
  WIDER ON -- ALL THE CHILDREN IN A CIRCLE AROUND LOGAN. They
  just stand there in the blast-radius of the carnage as the
  sun drifts lower in the sky.<br>

                         LAURA (O.S.)
               A man has to be what he is, Joey.
               You can't break the mould.<br>

  EXT. MOUNTAINS - LATE DAY<br>

  The young mutants lower Logan into the ground. BOBBY has made
  a simple wooden cross for Logan’s grave. Laura stares
  unrelenting at Logan as the dirt covers him.<br>

                         LAURA
               There's no living with a killing.
               There's no going back. Right or
               wrong, it's a brand. A brand that
               sticks. Now run on home to your
               mother, and tell her everything's
               alright. There's no more guns in
               the valley...<br>

  The children all look to Rictor.<br>

                         RICTOR
               We gotta go.<br>

  The children all grab their backpacks and start on the
  mountain trail to Canada.

  But Laura hesitates, still looking at Logan's grave. She does
  not move, but then, tearful, grabs her own backpack. As she
  passes Logan's makeshift cross, she looks at it a moment,
  considering, then kneels and tips it on its side to make --

  -- an “X”.

  The camera moves in on the X as in the distance, Laura joins
  her friends scaling the dark mountains, moving toward their
  future.

  CUT TO BLACK.

	<p id="1468">
From Logan<br>
  Meanwhile, the children stare at Pierce. He lies dead at
  their feet, mummified in ice, blood and twisted grass.

  Logan gets to his feet and reaches out for Laura.<br>

                       LAURA
            Laura. You need to get out.
                (to the other children)
            All of you. Get out of here! Now!<br>

  Suddenly, the is a metallic CREAK AND KLUNK AND X24 EMERGES,
  BLOODIED, FROM BENEATH THE TOPPLED VAN. The children scream
  as the monster makes a run at them.<br>

                       LOGAN
                (to the children)
            Go, go GO! Run!<br>

  The children comply, Laura most hesitant as --

  Logan stumbles to position himself between the children and
  the unstoppable fully healed creature charging at him --

  X-24 GORES LOGAN WITH BOTH HIS CLAWS and, using them like
  grappling hooks, drags Logan off to the forest's edge.<br>

                       LAURA
            No!<br>

  X24 heaves Logan onto a fallen stump, A JAGGED WOOD LIMB
  SPEARING THROUGH LOGAN'S TORSO. Logan howls in pain.

  Laura runs to the pistol in the grass. Pulls the Adamantium
  bullet from her pocket, fumbling to load the gun as--

  Delirious, losing blood, LOGAN grabs helplessly at X24’s
  claws (already plunged into him) as the monster jams them
  deeper, through him, and into the log-- then raises them for
  one last goring when --

  X24’s Adamantium skull suddenly explodes. He collapses to the
  ground. Done.

  Laura stands ten feet away, holding the smoking pistol. Her
  eyes meet Logan's and she drops the gun and runs to him.

  She hacks Logan from the tree stump. Logan slides painfully
  to the forest floor. He struggles to breathe. His body is
  decimated, his skeleton showing through his wounds.

  Laura's eyes are wild and fearful. She can see he is mortally
  wounded... She kneels.<br>

                      LAURA
            no, no, no...<br>

                       LOGAN
            ...Take your friends and run. Go.
            Listen to me, Laura. Run. They'll
            just keep coming and coming.
                (grips her)
            ...Don’t be what they made you.<br>

  The other mutant children emerge from the woods. Stand
  quietly at a distance.

  Logan watches them all, his eyes glassy, his body still.
  Laura takes Logan’s bloody hand, and this time, he holds on.<br>

                      LOGAN (CONT'D)
            ...it’s okay...<br>

                      LAURA
            No... ...daddy...<br>

  Logan looks at her. Then stiffens. Takes a short breath...
  And in his eyes, there is a flicker of wonder.<br>

                      LOGAN
            So this is what it feels like.<br>

  And then his breath releases and he is very still.

  Laura squeezes his limp hand. Disbelieving that he has
  passed. But there is nothing left in him.

  Still holding his hand, Laura looks up at her friends, tears
  in her eyes. The other children gather closer.

	<p id="1467">
From Logan<br>
  Laura and Logan come to a stop at the edge of the clearing.
  Pale and weak, Logan looks to Laura.<br>

                      LOGAN
            Go to your friends, Laura.<br>

  Laura takes a step but turns back as Logan adds--<br>

                      LOGAN (CONT'D)
            ...You'll know when.<br>

  Laura looks to-- Logan, clutching for air.<br>

                      PIERCE
            Green juice is wearing down, huh?
            For an ol' mute, that a short high.
            Gonna be hard to keep those claws
            out soon.<br>

                       RICTOR
                (thrashing, to Logan)
            Waste this dick, Logan!<br>

  Pierce knocks Rictor unconscious with the butt of his gun,
  then aims the muzzle at Rictor's head. He looks back up at--

  Logan, weak, standing there. Dr. Rice steps up behind Pierce.<br>

                      DR. RICE
            Please stop, Mr. Howlett, or I am
            going to have to tell these men to
            fire on these children. You can see
            the effects of the serum are
            wearing off. You will not survive
            any further wounds.<br>

  Logan glares at Rice, glances at Laura as she encircles the
  remaining Reavers guarding her friends.<br>

                      DR. RICE (CONT'D)
            It's an honor to meet you. I’m
            Zander Rice. I believe you knew my
            father on the Weapon X program.<br>

  Logan’s dark look goes darker. He holds up his bloody claws.<br>

                      LOGAN
            He’s the asshole who put this
            poison in me.<br>

                      DR. RICE
            Yes he was. One of them.<br>

                      LOGAN
            I think I might have killed him.<br>

                      DR. RICE
            I think you're right.<br>

                      PIERCE
            Shit. Show some respect, mutey.
            You’re lookin’ at the man who wiped
            out your kind.<br>

                      DR. RICE
            My friend Donald overstates. The
            goal was not ending mutant-kind but
            controlling it. I realized we
            needn’t stop perfecting what we eat
            and drink when we could use those
            products to perfect ourselves.<br>

  Laura sneaks closer to two of the Reavers, poised to attack.<br>

                      DR. RICE (CONT'D)
            To distribute gene therapy
            discreetly, through, well,
            everything -- from sweet drinks to
            breakfast cereal. And it worked.<br>

                      DR. RICE (CONT'D)
            Random mutancy went the way of
            polio. And we embarked on our next
            endeavor.<br>

  Logan's eyes drift from Pierce to Rice to Laura, claws out.<br>

                      LOGAN
            Growing mutants of your own.<br>

                      PIERCE
            Dangerous times, James. We can’t
            trust fate to--<br>

  He lifts his pistol AND SHOOTS ZANDER RICE IN THE HEAD. The
  Doctor falls back, dead, in the grass.<br>

                      LOGAN
            Yeah. Dangerous.

  INT./EXT. CLIFF TOP STRUCTURE -- EDEN -- NIGHT<br>

  Outside, the kids all sit before a fire, perched on their
  rucksacks, eating from cans of food. Eager to make the trip.

  Inside, Logan ties his boots sitting on the cot, observing
  them with a hint of nostalgia -- the chatty camaraderie, two
  of the kids goofing with their powers, laughter-- it tugs
  unexpectedly at him.

  And then he notices LAURA staring at him. A little hard, a
  little cryptic. Logan turns to her.<br>

                       LOGAN
            They seem nice. Your friends.
                (admits)
            Kinda remind me--<br>

  Laura abruptly rises and marches off. Logan thrown --

  LAURA

  is about to go outside -- when Logan GRABS her arm and tugs
  her to his bunk area.<br>

                      LOGAN (CONT’D)
            What's going on with you?<br>

  She ignores him, yanking her arm free --<br>

                      LOGAN (CONT’D)
            Hey. I asked you a question. What
            are you pissed about? You're with
            your friends. You made it.<br>

                      LAURA
            And where will you go?<br>

  Logan considers this a moment, smiles--<br>

                      LOGAN
            Nearest bar, for starters.<br>

  Laura absorbs the answer, starts to exit.<br>

                      LOGAN (CONT'D)
            What-- you thought I was coming
            along?<br>

  She glares back at him-- clearly, yes.<br>

                      LOGAN (CONT'D)
            That was never the deal. I got you
            this far, that’s all I signed up
            for. I gave back the money --<br>

                      LAURA
            Such a nice man.<br>

                      LOGAN
            Hey, I never asked for this.<br>

  She starts to move off again.<br>

                      LOGAN (CONT'D)
            Look, I don’t know what Charles put
            in your head, but I’m not...
            whatever it is you think I am.<br>

  Laura looks off, defiant, hurt.<br>

                      LOGAN (CONT’D)
            You don’t need me. You’ve got
            Rictor, Delilah, Rebecca, Bobby,
            blah blah whoever. Hey. It’s better
            this way. I suck at this. Bad shit
            happens to people I care about.<br>

  Laura meets his eyes.<br>

                      LAURA
            Then I will be fine.<br>

  And she walks off.

  ON LOGAN, watching her go. Resisting every urge to chase
  after her-- he SLAMS the door.

  ON LAURA OUTSIDE, at the edge of the cliff, looking out at
  the stars as she wipes her eyes, the faint laughter and noise
  of the kids nearby. She glances back at Logan’s door... then
  turns to join them.

  INT./EXT. EDEN - LOOKOUT TOWER - DAY<br>

  Logan finds Laura and the other mutant children packing up
  belongings. The older ones lead younger ones-- loading guns,
  stocking ammo, prepared for anything.

  Rictor is hunched over a short wave radio. There are voices.
  In French. He clicks off, crosses to the railing, addresses
  the others like an adolescent general:<br>

                      RICTOR
            That was the signal. They're ready
            for us on the other side.<br>

  Everyone doubles their efforts. Logan joins Laura at an OLD
  MOUNTED TELESCOPE.<br>

                      RICTOR (CONT'D)
            It's a ten mile hike through the
            woods, and then, see that pass?<br>

  Laura nods, eye pressed to the viewfinder...

  Logan looks out at a distant, rugged mountain looms beyond a
  swath of dense forest. There is a crevasse.<br>

                      RICTOR (CONT’D)
            Through there. That’s the border.
            That's where we can be free.<br>

  Rictor now turns to Logan.<br>

                      LOGAN
            Okay. Good.<br>

                      RICTOR
            ...Come with me.<br>

  Logan notices Laura watching him tentatively. As if gauging
  how he’s going to react to something...<br>

                       RICTOR (CONT'D)
            Come.<br>

  ...Rictor takes Logan by the arm and guides him, still
  limping, to a closet --<br>

                      RICTOR (CONT'D)
            Laura told me all you did for her.
            She was lucky to have you. Not
            everyone was so lucky.<br>

  Logan glances back at Laura, still watching him carefully.

  Rictor opens a cupboard and hands Logan what is left of the
  old envelope of cash. Logan stares down at the money --<br>

                      LOGAN
            Keep it. For your supplies or
            whatever.<br>

                      RICTOR
            She says it’s yours.<br>

  Logan pushes the cash back in Rictor’s hands.<br>

                      LOGAN
            Yeah. Well. Look. I don’t need
            this. You do. For supplies. Buy her
            some cereal.<br>

  Rictor regards him a moment, nods solemnly and exits.

  INT. CLIFF TOP STRUCTURE -- NIGHT<br>

  From across the darkened room, Bobby walks up to Logan. Logan
  considers him a moment. Bobby holds up an action figures, a
  vintage toy, the paint chipped. As if expecting a reaction
  from him. It’s a Wolverine figure, then he holds up another.<br>

                      BOBBY
            ...Was Sabretooth real?<br>

                       LOGAN
            What.<br>

                      BOBBY
            Laura said you said all the stories
            in the comic books were lies.<br>

                      LOGAN
            Not all. Not completely. Sabretooth
            was real. He was in a program with
            me. Like what they did to you.<br>

                      BOBBY
            So you did mean things with him.<br>

                       LOGAN
            Yes.<br>

                      BOBBY
            But now you’re doing good things.<br>

  Logan looks at the kid a moment, then--<br>

                      LOGAN
            Kid, I don’t know what I’m doing.<br>

  INT. CLIFF TOP STRUCTURE -- NIGHT<br>

  Logan wakes with a start, screaming. There is only one child
  tending him. It is LAURA. She sits on a chair beside him,
  watching him. He meets her eyes, disoriented, shaken.<br>

                        LAURA
              Pesadillas. ...you had night-mare.<br>

  Logan just looks at her.<br>

                        LOGAN
              Do you have nightmares?<br>

  She nods.<br>

                        LAURA
              ...People hurt me.<br>

                        LOGAN
              Mine are different.<br>

                         LAURA
            Por que?<br>

                      LOGAN
            I hurt people.<br>

  Laura takes this in. Then pulls something from her pocket.
  Logan’s Adamantium bullet.<br>

                       LAURA
                (in Spanish)
            What is this?<br>

                      LOGAN
            You know what it is.<br>

  Logan nods, tries to sit up. In pain. She hands it to him.
  He rolls it in his fingers.<br>

                       LOGAN (CONT’D)
            It’s made of Adamantium. Same thing
            they put inside us. That’s why it
            can kill us. Probably killing me
            now. Anyway, I got that a long time
            ago. Kept it as a reminder of what
            I am. Now I keep it to--
                (looks at her plainly)
            Actually, I was thinking about
            shooting myself with it. Like
            Charles said.<br>

  Laura’s smile fades.<br>

                      LAURA
            I’ve hurt people too.<br>

  Logan looks off.<br>

                      LOGAN
            You’re gonna have to learn how to
            live with that.<br>

                      LAURA
            They were bad people.<br>

                      LOGAN
            All the same.<br>

  Logan closes his eyes. The bullet sits in his open palm.
  Laura takes it.

  INT./EXT. STATION WAGON - HIGHWAY - BADLANDS - DAY<br>

  Logan at the wheel. Laura shoves him and he wakes up, swerves
  back off the shoulder. She nods to the wheel, speaks Spanish:<br>

                      LAURA
            Let me drive.<br>

                      LOGAN
            No. Absolutely not.<br>

  He’s barely awake. Barely alive, it seems. He’s bruised and
  broken. Blood runs from his sleeve from some unseen cut or
  cuts on his arm. He turns to see Laura still looking his way.<br>

                      LOGAN (CONT’D)
            Quit looking at me.<br>

                       LAURA

  Logan turns to her. Looks away. To weary to say anything.<br>


                       LAURA (CONT'D)
            You want to die.
                (off Logan’s look)

            What else did he tell you?<br>

                      LAURA
            To not let you.

  She grabs the wheel, pulls to the right, taking them onto the
  shoulder. Logan tries to fight it but can’t. Hits the brakes.<br>

                        LOGAN

  He hits the brakes.<br>

            Okay. Look. This place. Your mom...
            she read too many... stories.<br>

  Laura just ignores him, reaches into her backpack and takes
  out the comic, opens it.. Shows him an image of the idyllic
  Box Canyon...<br>

                      LOGAN (CONT’D)
            Yeah, I know... I saw it...<br>

  She holds up another picture from the page he’d read in the
  bar, another drawing showing “Eden.”<br>

                       LOGAN (CONT’D)
            Right. This place does not exist.
            No exist-o. It’s fictional.

                (starts coughing)
            No. I am saying that place is

            right there--
                (points at cover, authors)
            --those are the names of the people
            who made up these stories.
            Something happened once and these

  Laura bursts out with more Spanish--<br>

                      LAURA
            Le pagaron me llevo a este lugar!
            ¿Por qué no puedes llevarme a este
            lugar!<br>

  Then, exasperated, rummages through her pack. He sits there,
  too tired to fight, watches as she comes up with a MAP. She
  points to where they are, and to where they need to go.<br>

                      LOGAN
            Yes, I know. It’s a long way.<br>

  She punches him in the arm. Hard.<br>

  She goes to punch him again. He catches her fist.<br>

  INT. URGENT CARE CENTER - TREATMENT ROOM - DAY<br>

  Logan lies, hooked to an IV on a small bed. He coughs and
  opens his eyes. He is in the examination room of some sort of
  small town walk-in clinic. The place is decorated in a Rocky
  Mountain style. Out the windows, granite peaks. An Old Doctor
  stands over him. He has a soulful face, a bolo tie and big
  belt buckle. Reminds one of Richard Farnsworth.<br>

                      OLD DOCTOR
            Welcome back. I was starting to
            think I was gonna have to tell that
            nice little girl out in the waiting
            room that her daddy’s gone.<br>

  Logan notices the EKG monitor connected to him. The Doctor
  sits down and smiles...<br>

                      OLD DOCTOR (CONT’D)
            I always hoped I would get a chance
            to meet someone like you. There’s

                      OLD DOCTOR
            What you need is rest... and
            treatment. You need to check

            --I’m alright. I’m fine.<br>

                      OLD DOCTOR
            No. You’re not. I mean, I know
            you’re different. But that doesn’t
            change the fact that something
            inside you is poisoning you. You
            need to check yourself into a
            hospital and run some tests, find

            We learned the hard way with the

            were children, their emotional
            responses could be manipulated. But
            you can’t nurture rage. You must

  INT. FARMHOUSE -- SPARE BEDROOM -- NIGHT<br>

  Crickets buzz in the fields. A breeze blows. Charles lies
  awake, looking out at the crescent moon over the farm. His
  eyes travel downward to find-- Laura asleep on a hooked rug.

  Then: A FLOORBOARD CREAKS and Charles turns to see-- LOGAN,
  in the doorway, in silhouette. He looks at Laura asleep on
  the floor, curled like a shrimp. He takes a step toward her.<br>

                      CHARLES
            ...Don’t wake her yet. Let her have
            another hour.<br>

  Logan looks at Charles. Charles lays back on the pillow
  looking out the window at the farm. Something stirring him.<br>

                      CHARLES (CONT’D)
            ...This was, without a doubt, the
            most splendid night I’ve had in a
            long time. ...but then...<br>

  As Logan takes another step toward Laura, Charles trembles.
  He does not look away from the window.<br>

                       CHARLES (CONT'D)
            ...I don’t deserve it, do I?
                (then)
            ...I did something... unspeakable.<br>

  Logan turns.<br>

                      CHARLES (CONT'D)
            I remembered what happened in
            Westchester. This was not the first
            time I've hurt people.

                (pain fills his eyes)
            Until today, I didn’t know. You
            wouldn’t tell me. We just kept
            running from it. I’m done running.<br>

  Charles turns to Logan.<br>

                       CHARLES (CONT’D)
                (almost funny)
            I think I finally understand you,
            Logan...
                (dead serious)
            ...the burden you carry...<br>

  Logan arrives at Charles bedside. Puts his hand on Charles’
  shoulder. Charles cocks his head, perplexed, looking up at
  him in the shadows. Something is wrong.<br>

                       CHARLES (CONT’D)
            Logan...<br>

  LOGAN PRESSES HIS FIST INTO CHARLES’ CHEST.

  Charles GASPS. Logan pulls his hand back and that’s when we
  see his CLAWS ARE BLOODY.

  On the floor, LAURA OPENS HER EYES.

  Charles LOOKS UP FROM HIS WOUND, blood coming. He tries to
  reach a bedside light and succeeds as again-- THE CLAWS
  PLUNGE INTO HIS CHEST. IN THE LIGHT WE SEE -- THIS IS A
  PERFECT DOUBLE OF LOGAN.

  For simplicity’s sake, let’s call this creature BAD LOGAN.

  He will also be referenced as “X-24”, his model number. He
  is a younger, stronger, clone of The Wolverine. Feral, he
  moves in a slight crouch. He is not the absence of emotion
  but rather, the presence of it, most noticeably, rage.

  LAURA FLIES AT BAD LOGAN, SHRIEKING, landing on his back,
  gouging his flesh. He spins, trying to shake her, swiping at
  his back with his blades. He stumbles across the room and
  slams his back on the wall, crushing her, plaster cracking.

  LAURA DROPS TO THE GROUND. Dazed.<br>

                       NATE (O.S.)
            Hey!<br>

  NATE STANDS IN THE DOORWAY, a Louisville Slugger in his hand.

  His wide eyes take in Charles, bleeding, still moving, Laura
  on the floor, claws covered in blood. Then he looks to BAD
  LOGAN-- AND LUNGES--

  A METALLIC THWACK as the bat connects with Bad Logan’s head,
  but the clone hardly registers the impact AS WE CUT TO :

  INT. ALKALI COMMAND VEHICLE -- COUNTRY ROAD -- CONTINUOUS<br>

  The tinny transmitted sounds of the violence play off screen
  as we look at the Munson farmhouse a ways off through a
  windshield. PAN TO REVEAL--

  WE'RE IN THE ALKALI COMMAND VEHICLE. PIERCE AND DR. RICE are
  riveted to a feed from Bad Logan’s bodycam.<br>

                      PIERCE

            most wanted mutey in the world.<br>

                      DR. RICE
            He’s fantastic.<br>

  Caliban stares, stricken, his face pressed against the bars
  in his cage in the rear of the truck.<br>

                      CALIBAN
            You said you wanted the girl! You
            said you just wanted the girl!<br>

  ANOTHER REAVER SMACKS THE CAGE, knocking Caliban down.<br>

  EXT. PUMP HOUSE - NIGHT<br>

  Logan watches a TRUCK come up the road as Will puts a new
  lock on the gate.<br>

                      WILL
            Don’t know why I bother.<br>

  He now turns and sees the vehicle as well. Steps forward.<br>

                      WILL (CONT’D)
            Stay here, James. I’ll handle this.<br>

  Will walks forward with a thick wrench at his side.

  The Truck pulls up. On the side it says CANEWOOD BEVERAGE.
  FOUR BIG MEN get out. All with weapons. One of them gets out
  on the driver’s side, holding a rifle. This is JACKSON.<br>

                      JACKSON
            Evening, Mr. Munson.<br>

  Will just nods.<br>

                      JACKSON (CONT'D)
            What brings you out this way?<br>

                      WILL
            Why don’t you ask your boys?<br>

                      JACKSON
            You understand, you’re trespassing
            right now, right?<br>

                      WILL
            I have an easement with the
            previous owner of your property.<br>

                       JACKSON
            Previous being the operative word.
                (looks at Logan)
            Who’s this?<br>

                       LOGAN
                (before Will can speak)
            I’m nobody. Just a guy telling you
            to get back in your nice truck and
            play Okie dickhead somewhere else.<br>

  Jackson smiles, cuts a look at the others, then...<br>

                      JACKSON
            You hire some muscle, Mr. Munson?<br>

                      WILL
            He’s a friend of mine.<br>

                      JACKSON
            A friend with a big mouth.<br>

                      LOGAN
            I hear that a lot.<br>

                      JACKSON
            Then you probably hear this, too.<br>

  And now he cocks the rifle. Logan nods.<br>

                      LOGAN
            More than I’d like.<br>

                      JACKSON
            Then you know the drill. I’m gonna
            count to three and you are gonna
            start walking away.<br>

  He nods to the dark field.<br>

                      WILL
            I got rights to this water --<br>

                       JACKSON
            One.<br>

                      WILL
            And I have a lawyer now--<br>

                       JACKSON
            Two--<br>

  And that’s when Logan reaches out and snatches the rifle from
  Jackson by the barrel, surprising everyone. Especially when
  he slams the butt of it into Jackson’s face.<br>

                       LOGAN
            Three.<br>

  Jackson goes down to his knees clutching his bloody face as
  the other three move on Logan.

  Will pulls his pistol and hits one across the face, points it
  at the other two as Logan flips the rifle, points it at them.<br>

                       LOGAN (CONT’D)
            You all know the drill.
                (fires above their heads)
            Go.

            Some ways I envy you. They get to
            be Nate’s age, the nonsense that
            comes out their mouth. Makes you
            question the point of it all.<br>

  Logan smiles, nods. Tell me about it.<br>

                      WILL (CONT’D)
            Hard thing, fatherhood. Never ends.<br>

  Logan considers Will a long moment as the man works.<br>

                      LOGAN
            You’re a lucky man.<br>

                       WILL

  The WATER FINALLY STOPS RUSHING IN.<br>

                      LOGAN

            Canewood Beverage bought up
            everything out here. Except us.
            When we wouldn’t sell, they tried

  Looking at the giant harvesters working the dark fields.<br>

                      WILL (CONT'D)
            They're like dinosaurs. Twenty ton
            bodies with little tiny brains.
            They work day and night, no
            drivers, shucking their cloned up
            super-corn. Bears fruit in half the
            time. Taste like shit, though.<br>

                       WILL
            They don’t. They drink it.
                (off Logan’s look)
            Corn syrup. Its in all those

                       CHARLES
            You know, Logan. This is what life
            looks like. A house, people who
            love each other. A safe place. Take
            a moment and feel it.

  Logan looks off, distant. Troubled.<br>

            Charles. The world is not the same
            as it was. We're taking a risk
            here. And where we're going. Eden.
            It doesn't exist. Her nurse got it

  Friendly laughter around the table. THE SOUND FADES. PASSAGE
  OF TIME AS Laura watches the ritual of Family Dinner. Studies
  it. She’s never really seen a family. Or, for that matter, a
  teenage boy. She keeps her eyes fixed on him.

  stares up and out the window at all of them.

  One of them inches over and Logan is almost run off the road.<br>

            Laura’s foot claws are an obvious
            result of her gender.
                (off Logan’s look)
            In a pride of lions, females are
            caregivers of the young and hunters
            of the pride, they have front claws
            to hunt and foot claws for defense.
            They use the foot claw to strike
            the belly or bladder of the
            attacker, thus ensuring their
            escape and survival.<br>

  Laura takes this in, turns and looks out the other window.

            Self loathing. Anger. Disdain.

            your valleys. Mostly valleys-- it’s
            all so Goddamn boring.<br>

  Laura looks from one to the other, nervous for the first time
  since she climbed into the car with these two. She starts
  flicking the locks again.<br>

                      CHARLES (CONT’D)
            You honestly derive no sense of
            purpose from what we’re doing?<br>

            What are we doing?!<br>

                      CHARLES
            There is a young mutant. Sitting in
            our car.
            And where we are taking her, there
            are more of them. Does that mean
            nothing to you?<br>

                      LOGAN
            Yes. It means nothing to me.
            Especially since Nurse Gabriela
            made all this Eden shit up from
            fucking comic books.<br>

  Logan looks up as he hears a sigh from Charles.

  Logan clears his throat and they both turn his way. He holds
  up the THE X-MEN COMIC.<br>

                      LOGAN
            You read this in your spare time?<br>

  She sees the comic in his hand, backpack in the other--gets
  up and grabs them both from Logan and turns back to the film.<br>

            You do know this is bullshit,
            right? A quarter of it happened.

            world, people die and no self

  Logan turns to Charles who forces a smile.<br>

                       CHARLES (CONT’D)

            We don’t bring them cake, Maria. We
            do not dress them up for Halloween.
            We do not call them baby or kiss
            boo boos. They’re part of a study.
            Do not think of them as children.
            Think of them as things.<br>

                      GABRIELA
            They told us they were part of a
            pharmaceutical study.
            But of course, that was a lie.
            They thought we were too poor and
            stupid to understand. We are poor,
            but we are not stupid. I knew what
            they were doing.
            They taught them to kill-- but they
            did not remove their hearts.<br>

  ANOTHER CHILD IS FORCIBLY CUFFED IN A NOW FAMILIAR RESTRAINT
  SYSTEM, hissing, spitting, VIBRATING, loose objects flying
  around the room. OTHER CHILDREN WATCH. Some weep.<br>

                      GABRIELA (CONT’D)
            They could not be controlled.<br>

  ANOTHER SHOT -- A trickle of blood runs to a drain. TILT TO
  FIND A YOUNG LAURA IN A SMOCK, seemingly drugged, SITTING on
  the floor of a tiled room. She stares at her arm as she cuts
  it with a metal claw, then watches it heal, then cuts again.

  The camera/phone drops and we see a dutched image of Laura as
  Gabriela comforts her, saying “What are you doing, baby?” in
  Spanish. Laura cries on her shoulder.<br>

                      GABRIELA (CONT’D)
            A soldier who cannot be controlled
            is not a good soldier.<br>


                      GABRIELA (CONT’D)
            They told us to destroy files. They
            said the Cancer program had failed.<br>

  The female Mexican staff, some crying, shred medical files as
  out the door a child is dragged away by A REAVER...<br>

                      GABRIELA (CONT’D)
            They started putting the children
            to sleep. Like dogs.<br>

  We hear Gabriela telling them (in Spanish) that “we cannot
  let them do this”. Some of the staff meet her eyes.

  NEW SHOT-- GABRIELA IN A SUPPLY CLOSET, DOOR CRACKED...<br>

                       GABRIELA (CONT’D)
                (hushed)
            We are going to save as many as we
            can. I have read about a place in
            the north. A place for mutants.
            They call it Eden.<br>

  SOME FLASHES OF IMAGES OF AN ESCAPE. AN ALARM SOUNDING.
  PANIC. SECURITY. FEDERALES COMING TO THE LAB. RUNNING. CRYING
  CHILDREN. Exhortations to the kids to keep running. GUNFIRE.

  LOGAN REACTS TO THE CHAOS.<br>

                      GABRIELA (CONT’D)
            I have not shown anyone what you
            have now seen. Not until I am sure
            Laura is safe.<br>

  AND NOW ON THE PHONE -- AN IMAGE OF GABRIELA LOPEZ IN THE
  MOTEL ROOM, BARELY ABLE TO KEEP HER HEAD UP...<br>

                      GABRIELA (CONT’D)
            If you are watching this, it means
            I am dead. I am not sure if any
            other children survived. We were
            separated. I am sorry, but there is
            no more money. That was a lie. You
            have everything I have in my life.<br>

  Logan reacts to this.<br>

                       GABRIELA (CONT'D)
            She is not my child... but I love
            her. You may not love her but she
            is your child. I see now you are
            not a hero. You are not what I read
            about. Maybe you never were. But
            please, I beg you, please bring her
            to safety.<br>

  The recording ends. Logan tosses the phone down.

  He reaches up for the mirror, adjusts it so he can see--

  Laura. Lying there, in a ball, sleeping, a plastic horse doll
  in her hands. Some comic books under her head. Suddenly, she
  awakes, her eyes meeting his. And holding.

  Logan blinks under the weight of her gaze. Then she looks
  away and rolls over.

            Hey!<br>

  THE GIRL IN THE SLICKER HAS SMASHED a motel window with her
  ball. The Manager advances on her with a broom. The girl
  stares, fascinated and perhaps amused by the angry woman.<br>

  INT. LIBERTY MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT<br>

  Logan helps Gabriela to the bed. He takes in the mess of
  files, print outs, clippings, toys. He notices a medical kit.
  Cracks it open, fully stocked, looks at Gabriela.<br>

            I‘m a nurse.
            Was. In Mexico City.<br>

  Logan watches as Gabriela lifts her sleeve, takes things from
  the kit, ministering to her wound.<br>

  GABRIELA reaches for the NIGHT STAND, pries open its cheap side
  paneling, and pulls out a bloody envelope hidden there. Hands
  it to Logan. There’s an address on the outside and a set of
  numbers beneath it. Inside, bundles of greenbacks.<br>

            Charles, you’re making this--<br>

  Charles lunges for the needle and as Logan pulls it away,
  CHARLES FALLS OUT OF THE CHAIR to the floor. He looks up at
  Logan, enraged. A RINGING SOUND begins to rise...<br>

                      CHARLES
            What are you fucking doing to me!?<br>

                      CHARLES
            How long have I been here?<br>

  Logan carries him to the bed and sets him down. Charles looks
  around, in tears. Logan doesn’t answer, dumps two pills into
  his palm which he transfers to Charles' hand.<br>

                      CHARLES (CONT’D)
            What are these?<br>

                      LOGAN
            You remember what they are. The
            shots mellow the seizures, the
            pills keep them from happening.<br>

  Charles stares at the pills.<br>

                       LOGAN (CONT’D)
            How ‘bout you blow on them to make
            them safe.<br>

  Charles looks up at Logan.<br>

                      CHARLES
            Fuck off, Logan.<br>

                      LOGAN
            So you know who I am now.<br>

                      CHARLES
            I always know who you are.
            Sometimes I just don't recognize you.<br>

                      LOGAN
            Take the pills.<br>

  Charles pops them in his mouth, swallows them. Logan starts
  to clean up the spilled dinner.<br>

                       CHARLES

            ...you leave me alone with that
            fucking Albino... he won’t listen

            when I see one.<br>

            A what?<br>

                       CHARLES
            A speciation.
            A new mutant. A young one.
            There are forces trying to kill
            them! They need help!<br>

                      LOGAN
            Too bad you're not in that business
            anymore.<br>

                       CHARLES
            They want your help, not mine.
                (off Logan’s look)
            Oh, yes. That’s how fucking stupid
            they are. They're waiting for you.
            At the Statue of Liberty.<br>

                      LOGAN
            The Statue of Liberty was a long
            time ago, Charles. A long time.<br>

  Logan crosses to the old man. Takes in the worry on his face.<br>

                      LOGAN (CONT’D)
            There are no new mutants. Hasn't
            been a new one born in twenty-five
            years. Not anywhere.<br>

  Charles looks off. The drugs mercifully tugging at him.<br>

                      CHARLES
            Impossible.<br>

  Logan pulls the quilt over the old man.<br>

                      LOGAN
            You always thought we were part of
            God's Plan. Maybe we were just
            God's mistake.<br>

  Charles touches Logan's face. A tender moment until--<br>

                      CHARLES
            What a disappointment you are.<br>

  Logan takes this in. Stung.<br>

                      CHARLES (CONT’D)

  Logan eyes him a hard beat, then turns to go.<br>

                      CHARLES (CONT’D)
            Answer me! Why are we here?<br>

  But Logan ignores him, moving for the hatch.<br>

            No one should have to live this

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
The worst thing in the world during a doctor's exam is sudden silence. Amy tried to think back to what Don had told her, about what he was going to check for. Something about dilation. Something about her cervix. He was expecting a baby, and she was expecting a cyst, but a third possibility suddenly occurred to her: Maybe it wasn't a baby or a cyst! Maybe it was something much, much worse!<br>
... I'm dying, she thought. They all know it, and they're wondering how to tell me.<br>
I should have drowned in Lava.<br>
..."Go ahead, tell me," she said flatly. "I'm dying, aren't I."<br>
"No, you're not dying," Don said. "As it turns out, you're about nine centimeters dilated. Which means your baby is pretty eager to make its entry into the world. I didn't expect to find you so far along. But I think you've been in the beginning stages of labor for a day, maybe even a few days. That back pain? The stomachaches that came and went? I'm actually surprised you stood it so well."<br>
"I'm not pregnant," Amy said. "I have a cyst."<br>
Don leaned forward. "It's not a cyst, Amy," he said. "You're one hundred and ten percent pregnant. And you're about to have the baby."<br>
"No," said Amy. "No, I am not!"<br>
Her mother's face appeared. "Yes, you are, honey," she said. "We're going to walk you through it."<br>
"No," said Amy, feeling the panic rise up. "You guys don't understand! I'm not pregnant!" She refused to give in on this. It simply couldn't be. She was not going to try to remember anything--not when or who or where. And she wasn't going to give in to the humiliation that would come if she had to admit something like this. Because for a girl to go nine months without knowing she was pregnant seemed like the ultimate in cluelessness. And she was a smart girl. She'd scored 2400 on her SATs. She was going to be applying to good colleges this fall. She was going to be that skinny college girl, biking across campus to meet her boyfriend.<br>
"Amy, listen," and now Don's face appeared in her circle of vision, and he looked directly into her eyes. "You are going to have a baby. Soon. It's already on its way. There's no other way out. It's like going down a rapid. Once you're in the tongue, you're committed."<br>
Amy shook her head.<br>
"You can do it," said Don, "because you have to do it. Try and rest because there will be another contraction coming."<br>
"No," Amy sobbed.<br>
"Don't cry!" Don said sharply. "You can't cry right now. When we get this baby out you can cry all you want, but right now, you can't cry." Her mother squeezed her hand. "He's right. Save your strength. This is the worst part. Make it through this, and you can make it through anything."<br>
"How do you know?" Amy snapped.<br>
Her mother laid a freshly dampened bandanna across Amy's forehead. "Because I've been there. Once you get to ten centimeters, then you can start to push, and it'll hurt too but not like this. This part is hell. The contractions are long and intense and come one right after another."<br>
Indeed, another one was starting--the tightening, the choking sensation, the deep imploding pain. She felt like she was being disemboweled. She tried to hold back a sob, but she was too afraid--afraid of the pain right now and also afraid of all the pain to follow. Done was right: there was no way out of this. Everywhere she looked, there was pain.<br>
Voices shouted but they were in the next world over. "I can't do this!" she screamed.<br>
"Yes, you can," said her mother. "Breathe!"<br>
"I can't!"<br>
"Amy," and she felt her mother's hands upon her face, turning her so that she was looking into her eyes. Her mother held up her index finger, right in front of Amy's mouth. "Amy. Look at my finger. See my finger? I want you to pretend it's a candle. Now blow it out!"<br>
Amy wrenched her head away, but her mother turned it back and continued to hold up her finger.<br>
"Blow," her mother commanded.<br>
Amy pursed her lips and managed a little puff.<br>
"That's right! Blow! Blow the candle out, honey! Deep breath in! Now little blows! That's great, honey. You're doing great!"<br>
Amy squeezed her mother's finger and tried to blow. The pain was both within and without, evil, twisting and stretching, and there was no letting up, no lessening of the force.<br>
"Blow," her mother said, and Amy was so angry at the pain that she grabbed her mother's finger and bit down hard.<br>
Afterward her mother sat back and wrung her hand.<br>
"I'm sorry," Amy said. "Did I break the skin?"<br>
Her mother held up her finger. There was no blood, just a row of pink molar tracks. "Next time maybe just blow?"<br>
"Next time she gets a stick," said Peter.<br>
Amy didn't laugh. "More ice."<br>
Susan stood up. "I'll be right back. Before the next one."<br>
Amy didn't want to be reminded of the next one. She closed her eyes and tried to go limp. The strangest images came to her from far away: her chemistry teacher's voice as he handed out their final, the smell of rain on hot pavement. The lack of pain right now was cool and sweet. She had already lost all sense of time, but now she felt herself floating as well, and she heard a humming sound. Then she felt something touch her lips, and she opened her eyes and saw that Peter was holding a cup for her.<br>
..."It's so bad," she told him. "It's unbelievably bad."<br>
"You can do it."<br>
"How?"<br>
"You will," he said. "You just will."<br>
Amy had heard those words many times, but hearing them from Peter was different. For the first time, she believed them.<br>
Although if anyone--Peter included--asked who the father was, she would get up and walk straight into the river and never return. She would. She really would.<br>
"The camera!" she said, suddenly remembering. "I lost it! All those pictures!"<br>
"Fuck' em."<br>
This made sense.

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
It was the timing that made it so bad, Susan told herself. That plus the context, being on the river and learning your daughter was, oh, in active labor. Whatever the reason, when Susan heard Amy tell her to shut up, she felt like she'd been stabbed.<br>
Well, it wasn't the nicest thing for her to say, said the Mother Bitch.<br>
Oh, it was rude; definitely it was rude. But the thing was, Amy was always telling her to shut up, and usually it didn't bother her in the least. When Susan complimented her on a new T-shirt, for instance, or tried to commiserate about the stress of taking five AP classes. Shut up, Mom. Susan always saw it as an affectionate warning that she was laying it on a little thick; and while she didn't like to admit it, sometimes it made her feel like part of a privileged club.<br>
But not today. Today the three little words sent a jolt through her heart, so swift and damaging that she had to flee the tent.<br>
She felt not only rejected by her daughter but humiliated and incompetent as well. What kind of mother didn't know her daughter was pregnant? Didn't she notice Amy gaining weight? Didn't she notice they weren't going through tampons at the regular rate? Didn't she wonder why Amy was throwing up before school?<br>
Why, she hadn't even wondered if Amy was having sex! And what kind of mother didn't wonder about that nowadays, with all the news reports, all the magazine articles about hooking up with STDs and middle-school girls giving blow jobs in the school bathrooms? What kind of mother didn't at least speculate?<br>
Susan, that's who. And why? Because Amy was fat. Fat girls didn't have boyfriends and didn't have sex.<br>
It made her want to throw herself into the river, to think she'd fallen for such a stereotype.<br>
Oh, stop it now, said the Mother Bitch. It's not like she has cancer.<br>
Susan knew that. She also knew that this was not the time to beat herself up for her mistakes or to cower from the few sharp words--not with Amy about to give birth under a makeshift tent at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. But she couldn't stop hurting. All the other times, Shut up meant Oh mom, you dork you. Today, it meant Go away. I truly hate you. I don't want your help. Ever.<br>
...Jill fell silent, but if Susan had spoken too sharply, she didn't care. Everyone could offer explanations, everyone could excuse her, but they weren't in her position. Jill certainly didn't know how it felt to realize you'd been so blind that you could fix your daughter breakfast and drive her to school and visit colleges and sleep next to her in a tiny pup tent--and not know. Jill had boys, not girls, and didn't understand that from the moment Amy was born, consciously or not, Susan had been waiting for the day her daughter anounced she was intentionally, happily pregnant, so that she, Susan, could exult, commiserate, advise. And now--to suddenly learn that an unplanned pregnancy had happened without either of them knowing!<br>
A movement caught her eye, and she saw Evelyn shuffling toward them, a water bottle dangling fom her finger. Susan bristled; she didn't think she could bear the presence of this odd, serious woman who held a PhD in molecular biology but possessed no sense of how to commune with the human race.<br>
..."All right," Jill began. "You didn't know. You missed the signs. But Amy needs you right now."<br>
"Amy doesn't need me." said Susan. "Amy doesn't want me, either."<br>
Evelyn looked anxious. "I don't think that's true," she said. "Of course Amy needs you. Of course she wants you. How can you say she doesn't?"<br>
"Maybe because I've got some experience with a teenager, Evelyn," susan said. Evelyn looked down, and Susan knew she had hurt this childless woman who was never going to face these muddled issues. But Susan didn't care. Hot tears spilled out.<br>
"Why didn't she tell me?" she cried.<br>
"She didn't know," Jill said.<br>
"But she didn't even tell me she was having sex! Did she think I would scold her? Tell her she was too young? She was--is--but I would never have scolded her! I would have taken her to the doctor, and then the doctor would have examined her, and we'd have known, and we wouldn't be here on the Colorado River with her going into labor!"<br>
..."I'm a failure," Susan sobbed.<br>
"Phooey," said Evelyn.<br>
"In fact, I'm such a failure that not only do i not know my daughter is pregnant, but when she's suddenly going into labor, all I can think about is how bad a parent I am. Isn't that rich!"<br>
Evelyn looked thoughtful for a moment. "So what you're saying is, you're a failure because not only have you failed your daughter, but in the process of failing her, all you can focus on is how you've failed?"<br>
Susan sobbed harder. "And I've done this all my life too. I always make everything all about me. No wonder Amy doesn't open up--she knows she'll just have to sit and listen to me talk and how it was for me me me, way back when."<br>
Evelyn and Jill pondered this.<br>
"I've just been trying so hard to connect with her," Susan said. "And nothing works."<br>
"Maybe not until now," Jill said gently. "But you can't just walk away when she needs you the most. You have to be the strong one right now."<br>
"You certainly do! I'd lay down the law with that girl," Evelyn declared, and she smacked a fist into her palm. "I'd say, 'Amy, I don't care what you say, I'm going to be right here by your side from start to finish!"<br>
Susan smiled wanly, for she'd had yet to witness this passionate side of Evelyn. She thought she would like to watch Evelyn teach a class sometime. Once she'd had a teacher who was passionate about wind patterns over the Pacific. By the end of the class, everyone else was passionate about wind patterns over the Pacific too.<br>
She wiped her nose. "I'm not usually so thin-skinned."<br>
"I think it's being on the river," Evelyn said.<br>
"Watching your daughter go into labor might have something to do with it too," added Jill.<br>
The three women helped each other stand up. Susan inhaled deeply. Her eyes stung from salt and sun, and she wanted again to walk into the river and float away.<br>
Instead, she gave a shaky little laugh. "My heart," she said hoarsely. "I feel like it's right here," and patted her arm.<br>
"Well," said Evelyn, "well, you just keep it right there, if that's what you need to do."

It occurred to JT that this might not be a good idea, getting Lloyd involved. On the other hand, what harm could he do? Even a confused mind could offer comfort, at the very least.<br>
...Lloyd: On the reservation, I delivered a set of twins. But I might be a little rusty.<br>
JT: Don't be rusty, Lloyd.<br>
"Don't sue me," Lloyd replied.<br>
...Now it seemed that the rope had no end, that it was just a long series of knots and tangles, a kind of Jacob's ladder into a bottomless hole. It had no meaning, being at the end of one's rope; you were either on it or off; nothing much mattered, except keeping everyone alive. And [JT] flashed on Mac once again, because Mac was one of those people who could always find another rope to grab, when all else failed.<br>
They had once made such a good pair, JT thought. And he felt a sudden stab of grief, to think that his marriage hadn't worked, that all his years on the river had passed without the one sweet love of his life by his side.<br>
...Don: I'm guessing the baby's head down. Which is good. You want your baby to be head down.<br>
Amy's expression didn't register this. He might just as well have told her of a new mathematical proof.<br>
..."Amy," [Susan, Amy's mom,] said, smoothing the girl's hair, "this is something we need to find out. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it's nothing you can't deal with. Not compared to these contractions, anyways."

[Amy] deserved privacy, in this land of giant openness. [Peter] moved to block their view.<br>
...But another part of [Peter] recognized himself as the same person who went over to his mother's every Saturday and watered her peonies, who cleaned out the Weber grill and threw away the vegetables that were rotting in the back of the refrigerator, who picked up his mother's medicine at the pharmacy and made sure she had enough refills authorized for the coming month. That was the kind of person he was. He might complain about it, but he did it, because it was the right thing to do.<br>
..."All I want are a couple of Tums," said Amy. "Is that too much to ask for?"<br>
"You know what? It is," [Peter] told her. "It is too much to ask for. All I want is for you to admit that you're pregnant, you're in labor, you're going to have a baby, and this is going to be a very big deal for the rest of us, because we're down on the river, and there isn't a hospital for miles around. And so a lot of people's plans are going to be altered for you. Which I'm not complaining about, but you should give up on this Tums thing and help people help you. Because as I understand it from Jill, the last thing we want is for this baby to actually be born down here. I don't know what can go wrong, and I don't want to know. But I imagine it can be pretty bad. So quit asking for Tums."

In the meantime, Abo had gotten a sleeping mat, and they all helped Amy lie back. Then Abo draped a sheet over here, for although her skin was dry and the temperature was well over a hundred degrees, she was shivering.<br>
"Is that comfortable?" JT asked.<br>
Amy shrugged.<br>
Though worried, he wanted to make light of things. "You're on the Lava Swim Team now, you know. Pretty elite."<br>
"Are there T-shirts?"<br>
"Are you kidding? T-shirts, hats, duffel bags, the whole shebang."<br>
"Good," said Amy, closing her eyes. "I was never on a team."<br>
...It wasn't a seizure. Evelyn knew that much. Julian had seizures. This wasn't a seizure. She wished people would listen to her. How was it that she was fifty years old and a full and tenured professor of biology at Harvard University, and still people didn't listen to her, unless she was up at the lectern? And even then.<br>
...Jill was trying to keep her face calm, but inside she was in ER mode. ER mode was where she went when Matthew broke his leg up at Alta and they looked at the X-ray and said, Actually, it's a lot worse than we thought, and see this little spot on the bone? ER mode was when Sam spiked a fever and got a stiff neck and then went limp in her arms; when Mark had chest pains, and they hooked him up to machines and wires and a counselor came and asked if he had a living will. She had always thought that ER mode was a place she only went when it involved her immediate family, but now she realized that was wrong.

The main thing Amy was aware of when she lid off the boat was the sudden cessation of earthly noise.<br>

Susan was so thrilled to be a member of the paddle team for Lava that she forgot to give Amy the customary hug before they boarded their separate boats. By the time she remembered, the lip of the rapid was fast approaching, and she scolded herself for being superstitious. A mother's hug wasn't going to keep Amy safe at this point. Amy was going to keep herself safe.

"A far cry from the boy who lost his sandal the first day, don't you think?" Mitchell asked. "I'm actually glad he got to paddle today. He'll remember this run for the rest of his life. And boy, will he have earned bragging rights back home."

At breakfast JT had to tell Mitchell to shut up with his stories. Despite the apprehension, everyone ate heartily. Yesterday's rift over Mark and Jill's parenting judgment had healed for the moment in the presence of excitement over Lava. They all applied sunblock liberally today, as though it would protect them from the rapids themselves.

"But it's the first thing you learn in wilderness school," Evelyn said indignantly. "You don't take unnecessary risks. And how was JT so sure that things hadn't changed since the last jump? What if there was a boulder he didn't know about? What if Sam was off by a couple of inches?"<br>
Mitchell grumbled his agreement, and he and Evelyn continued to imagine worst-case scenarios as they continued down the trail. Susan herself wondered what she would say at happy hour tonight. She really didn't feel like going off to drink wine with Jill, because she was afraid she wouldn't be able to keep her mouth shut. What kind of a mother are you, letting your son jump off a cliff, miles from nowhere?<br>
For once, Susan felt like she was on the same side as the Mother Bitch.<br>
...Peter: When Sam jumped.<br>
"Oh, you mean how [my mom] looked like this?" Amy turned around and pursed her lips fiercely. "Probably she thought Sam shouldn't jump. My mother can be very critical of other mothers' decision."<br>
...Peter: My mother's mean.<br>
Amy: She's lonely, from what you tell me.<br>
"And that's my fault?"<br>
"Just water her flowers," sighed Amy. "Sit with her. Drink a glass of lemonade. That's probably all she wants."<br>
"Like you're going to be so nice to your mother when she's old. I'm going to come and chew your ass off then," said Peter, "and remind you of how judgmental you were of me, once upon a time."<br>
"You won't even remember me two weeks after this trip."<br>
"I'll remember you. You think I'm Lloyd [who has Alzeimer's]?"<br>
"Lloyd's so sweet," said Amy. "We should save our money and do this trip next year, with Ruth and Lloyd. Without my mother, or course."

"You feeling okay?" JT asked. "Drinking enough?"<br>
[Jill] liked the way he was always checking on them. She felt taken care of, watched over; she felt safe.<br>
"You're such a parent," she told him.<br>
"Well," he said, allowing his half smile, "I guess I try."<br>
She'd planned on swimming but suddenly found herself chilled. Out in one of the green pools, Mark and the boys ducked and swam and splashed one another. Jill watched them without envy; they were doing what a father and his two sons ought to be doing on a trip like this. It was good for them to horse around. She found herself thinking back on all their family squabbles, the stupid everyday things--which kind of pizza, how many videos, who called shotgun, where all the money went, why did you wait until the night before the assignment was due?--and it all seemed ludicrous now. How could any of it matter?<br>
And as for their fight over Sam yielding his seat to Evelyn: What was wrong with a father trying to instill a sense of grace and generosity in his son?<br>
But she was still mad. What an odd, fickle day, she thought.<br>
..."How come you didn't swim?" [Mark] asked.<br>
"I was cold."<br>
"The water was warm."<br>
"Not warm enough for me," she said meanly.<br>
Mark rubbed her arms briskly, and she tolerated it. But in truth she wanted to go back to the boats. All this luxurious greenery was overwhelming her. She wanted rocks, river, sky. And some of Susan's wine, frankly.<br>
...Jill was lousy at estimating distances, but she would have guessed this to be a hundred feet up.<br>
"[JT's] going to jump?"<br>
"Every trip, rain or shine," Dixie said. "He calls it Continuing Education."<br>
..."It was pretty cool," said Sam nonchalantly. "Didn't you want to go, Matthrew?"<br>
"No," said Matthew. "I don't like heights." And Jill was flabbergasted at this level of maturity in her son, that he wouldn't try to go just because his younger brother had gone.<br>
...Mark: It meant a lot to [Sam]. If we made him come down, think how humiliated he'd have been. You can't do that to your kid. Not on the river. Not at age twelve.<br>
Jill: You can if it's a mile high.<br>
Mark: But it wasn't.<br>
"No, it wasn't. I really went by what Dixie said," said Jill, feeling a weight suddenly lifting. "I figured if JT thought it was safe, then it was safe. But I don't think some of the others felt that way."<br>
"That's their problem, then," Mark declared, and it gave her a thrill to hear him say that. If they'd not been in such a rush to get back, if they'd not been in such a heavily used area, Jill would have grabbed her husband's hand and dragged him off behind a tree for the quickest fuck in the history of their marriage.<br>
As it was, she had to wait until after dinner that evening, when JT got out his book of poetry and read to them all, and Jill and Mark were able to slip away unnoticed. Years later she would still be able to recall kneeling in the sand, Mark's fingers fluttering on her skin, the tacky warmth of his neck, the black river moving soundlessly in the night as they lay down together.

It was a tense dinner that night. Mitchell went off and ate by himself; Lena, having received a testy rebuke when she tried to follow him, stayed with the group for once and got a stern lecture from both Jill and Susan that she really didn't need to take Mitchell's bullying for the next thirty years.<br>
Lena: I wouldn't call him a bully.<br>
Evelyn: Somewhat overbearing?<br>
Lena: Mitchell has a hard time with groups.<br>
Susan: You don't need to make excuses.<br>
Lena: And he's wanted to do this stretch of the trip for so long. The city council wants him to give a slide show at the library, after he's finished Powell's journey. And he knows someone who used to work for National Geographic too. He might do a story for them. That's a long shot.<br>
Jill: Still, a little common courtesy goes a long way.<br>
Lena: I would never argue with that. But you people don't know Mitchell the way I do. You've known him for eight days. I've known him for thirty years. He can act like a boor, but he's not a boor at heart.<br>
...Peter: I don't care if I even have to go to jail. I am so sick of [Mitchell] making himself the center of attention. What, you're not eating?<br>
"Not hungry," said Amy.<br>
... "I ahve the best idea." And [Amy] proceeded, then to tell him about the idea that had just popped into her head. Peter thought at first it was too simplistic, that it wouldn't be mean enough and nobody would pick up on the nuances; but as she gave him one example after another, he marveled at the girl's ingenuity. Ten days ago he'd assumed she was merely somebody to tolerate. Now he was filled with admiration.<br>
"You can be really mean when you want," he told her.<br>
"I'm in high school," she reminded him.<br>
Amy's journal: ...Here's the plan: ... Peter and I are going to take pictures of Mitchell! Oh, and talking to Lena, so we can all remember how not to be treated by our husband someday.<br>
Then we make an album and post it online.<br>
Am I not the biggest bitch in the universe?

The dog wagged his tail, and Mitchell stooped and deposited one tidy pat onto the dog's head. Evelyn, Susan, and Jill looked on nervously.  Last night, when they were sitting around together, they'd taken turns sharing their fears, and Mitchell had confessed to being afraid of dogs. "When I was a kid, I got bit," he'd told them. "Some yappy little thing. And I have to admit that's the real reason I didn't want this dog on the trip. I should have been straightforward with you all. I'm sorry," he said. "Maybe on this river trip, I can get over my fear."<br>
So now they were all remembering Mitchell's confession and worrying he might go overboard in an attempt to undo years of trauma. Blender had been keeping his distance from Mitchell for most of the trip, of course; dogs can sense when someone is not inclined to offer a belly rub on short notice.<br>
... Mitchell stood up. "Hey, that's an idea. Okay, doggie, that's it for now," he said sternly. "Good doggie. All good things must come to an end. Time to go play by yourself. Time for Mitchell's gin and tonic."<br>
... With all this chatter, JT felt like his head was going to burst, this at a time when he needed to stay calm. Was it him, or were they having more medical crises than usual on this trip? He was grateful when Dixie squatted beside him with the first aid box.<br>
... "And what, he thought we were right around the corner from Walmart?" Mitchell spat into the sand. "I pay three thousand bucks and you can't provide me with a five-dollar roll of gauze?"<br>
All this time the Mother Bitch had been sitting off to the side, flossing. Shoot this guy, she said. Tie him to a rock. Let him fry.<br>
At that point, Lena spoke up in what seemed to everyone to be the first time she'd said much of anything the entire trip.<br>
"Mitchell," she said. "Behave yourself. We're a group, and someone else got hurt, and we used up the gauze. We didn't mean to but we did." Her use of the first-person plural reminded everyone that she did indeed teach kindergarten. "Now give me your handkerchief, and take this," and she handed him a paper towel.<br>
...Lena held up her hand. "I think it would help if everyone took a deep breath. Mitchell, you don't need stitches. The dog doesn't have rabies. Dixie and JT have everything they need to bandage you up. Now it's time to cooperate."

Expertise bred confidence, which in turn bred a collective good mood, no small factor on a river trip.<br>
... Only Susan was having a hard time at this point. Although she appreciated the ease of routine, a certain weariness was creeping in. Dare she call it boredom? Sometimes the rapids all seemmed alike; sometimes the canyon walls felt closed in. Was she the only one who was getting tired of all this beauty?<br>
By now her wine tasted like plastic, and it was never cold enough. The coffee was muddy. And to be perfectly frank, she was tired of group camping. Everyone snored, it seemed, and the mats were so thin that every morning she woke up with sore shoulders and a knot in her neck and a pain in her lower back that didn't disappear even after Dixie showed her how to stretch. There were scorpions to worry about, and red ants, and rattlesnakes.<br>
She was dragging her overnight bag down to the boats that morning when thee obvious occurred to her: There was an end to all this. Had she forgotten? In five days she'd emerge from the canyon heat and walk into an air-conditioned hotel room, with a ppillow-top mattress and cool sheets and her own personal refrigerator. There would be a clean robe hanging in the closet, chilled wine in the little refrigerator. She would step into a hot shower, stand beneath the silt-free spray, and wash thirteen days' worth of grit down the drain.<br>
"How do the guides do it?" she asked Jill the next afternoon.<br>
..."Do what?" asked Jill.<br>
"Stay so enthusiastic! I can't imagine making this trip twice, let alone a hundred and twenty-five times."<br>
"Oh, i could live down here," Jill said. "No laundry, no grocery stores, no carpools..."<br>
Susan would have agreed with her the first few days. But not at this point. At this point, she wanted a bath. She wanted to see a street lined with fat-leafed maple trees.<br>
"I miss my bed," she said. "And a mattress--what a concept! Air-conditioning, a quiet room to myself..."<br>
"But hasn't this trip been good for you and Amy?" Jill asked.<br>
"Amy wants absolutely nothing to do with me down here."<br>
Jill didn't reply, which disappointed Susan, for she'd hoped Jill would have some inside knowledge about Amy's feelings that would contradict her.<br>
"Amy would rather spend her time with Peter," Susan said.<br>
"But that's good, isn't it? She's seventeen, after all. Don't discount the power of peer relationships."<br>
Peer? thought Susan. He's twenty-seven.<br>
And he's always giving her beer, if you haven't noticed, said the Mother Bitch. If Amy weren't so fat, you'd think he was trying to take advantage of her.<br>
Susan felt her eyes smart. With two fingers, she reached under her lenses and dabbed at her lower lids.<br>
"What's the matter?" asked Jill.<br>
Susan smiled ruefully. It was hard for her to put her finger on it. She felt like such an awful mother for thinking the thoughts hse had sometimes. But there they were. perhaps this mother of two from Salt Lake City would understand, down here on the river.<br>
"Did you have a mental image of your children, before they were born?" she asked.<br>
"Sure! They were goin to look just like me."<br>
Susan laughed in spite of herself, for the Compson boys didn't look anything like Jill, being pink-skinned and blond, as opposed to Jill with her olive complexion and dark, wavy hair.<br>
"Well, I envioned a little girl with a Dutch cut and bangs," susan declared. "She would be able to sing. We would harmonize on long car rides. She would want a horse too."<br>
"I don't know about the singing, but I take it the horse didn't pan out?"<br>
"Or dance, or team sports, or tennis." Susan wanted suddenly to tell Jill about Amy's SAT scores. But she was afraid it would sound braggy.<br>
"Still, she's awfully nice," said Jill. "I noticed it the first night with the boys--teaching them card tricks and all. And she's smart. You can tell. She and Peter were talking about Virginia Woolf. I was impressed. Does she know where she wants to go to college?"<br>
"Possibly Duke," Susan said. "Maybe Yale."<br>
"You see? You should be proud of her!"<br>
"I am. I just..." Susan put her hands over her face. "Nobody tells it like it is," she cried. "The doctor calls her heavy. Her father calls her large. Everyone tiptoes around the fact that she's just terribly, terribly overweight. And she never, ever talks to me!"<br>
... Jill leaned over and patted water on her arms. "When I was a teenager, I had acne," she said. "And my parents denied it. They said, 'Oh, it's just a pimple here and there. Dab a little makeup on your face; you're the only one who notices it.' Which was not true. I looked like I had the chicken pox. And it must be especially hard, with you being so trim and all."<br>
"Sometimes I think that's what did it," sniffed Susan.<br>
"Why?"<br>
"Because I watch my weight. I like eating healthy. I like being thin. So maybe I made too big a deal over it, while Amy was growing up."<br>
Jill snorted. "Matthew's sensitive--does that mean I mollycoddled him? And Sam's a clown--does that mean I didn't give him enough attention? We mothers certainly blame ourselves too much."<br>
... "So what happened with Mark the other day?" Susan asked, once they were through.<br>
"Oh," said Jill, and she raised her face to the sun. "Too much togetherness, I guess."<br>
Susan knew that wasn't the case.<br>
"Fine," Jill said. "We bicker about the kids sometimes."<br>
"He's Mormon, isn't he?"<br>
"Right."<br>
"And you're not."<br>
"Right."<br>
"So how do you deal with that?" And Susan, who usually bent over backward not to pry too much, was able to marvel at her boldness. How long, she asked herself, might it have taken her to ask Jill these things, if they hadn't been on the river together?<br>
"You mean, am I the lost soul of the tribe? Mostly it's a problem for his parents," said Jill. "We get together at holidays, and they want to see my pantry, and I show them my pantry, and they say, 'That's not a pantry; we mean a ree-ul payantree,' and Mark steps in at that point and reminds them that we've had mice and don't really feel like storing a hundred pounds of rice in our basement."<br>
"That's nice, that he sticks up for you."<br>
"I suppose. Although being the bitch that I am, I always focus on what he doesn't do for me, instead of what he does do."<br>
Both women chuckled, in mutual recognition.<br>
"Remind me again, where's Amy's father?" Jill asked.<br>
"Boston," Susan replied. "Amy goes and visits him in August. He has a cottage on a lake. She babysits his kids." It suddenly seemed pathetic to her, that that was what her daughter did for the month of August at age seventeen.<br>
"What's high school been like for her?" Jill asked. "I know when I was in high school, kids were pretty cruel. Is it still as bad?"<br>
"It was worse in middle school," Susan said. "Now they just ignore her. Although I will admit that she's gone to a few parties this past year, like last Halloween. But then she didn't go out much after that. Not sure why."<br>
"Well, it's a start," said Jill. "Does she have a boyfriend?"<br>
Susan wanted to throw her arms around Jill, simply for asking. None of her friends back in Mequon had ever thought to wonder.<br>
"Be careful what you wish for," Jill declared. "From what my sister says, sometimes it's best that we don't know everything our kids do."

It occured to [Peter] that he might inquire, while he was here, about getting his guide's license. It couldn't be all that hard; the way he saw it, you simply made friends with gravity and let the water do the work.

As if on cue, JT asked her how she was doing.<br>
"I'm sorry. I couldn't get a grip," she said meekly.<br>
"Hey. You did great."<br>
"No, I didn't!" Amy exclaimed. "I almost made us flip!"<br>
JT shrugged dismissively. "It's never one person's fault."<br>
It was in this case, Amy wanted to say. And she flashed back on the image of her lying on stop of JT--smooshing him, really, all 237 pounds of her; of burying her face against his neck for the briefest of moments (warm skin, creased and tacky and smelling of maple); and she thought that he was an awfully good man, a better man than any she had ever met, the kind of man she hoped one day would see her for the person she was, underneath all this flab.

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
It's not about the rapids, JT always emphasized to his passengers. It's about the side canyons. it's about sleeping bneath the stars. It's about layers of rock, and quiet currents, and jungles growing out of hot red rock.<br>
... A low murmur of excitement stirred through the group. A Monster, some of them had read. King Kong. The Maelstrom. Its nicknames were well earned. Crystal was one of the two biggest rapids on the river, a hydraulic traffic jam that could make even the most seasoned guide quake with fear.<br>
"There's a lot of hype with this one, and it's well deserved," JT told them. "But more often than not, we manage a nice smooth run down the right, and it's over before you can blink. Ruth and Lloyd, I want you in my boat. Abo? Did you figure out who's paddling?"<br>
... As it turned out, a lot of people wanted the space, so Abo had them draw staws--or rather, strips torn from an empty cereal box. In the end, it was between Sam and Evelyn. Abo fanned the two strips. Sam wiggled his fingers, then drew. Then evelyn drew, and they compared.<br>
"Whoo-hoo!" sam shouted.<br>
..."Sam," [Mark] began, "we want you to rethink this."<br>
Sam eyed them both warily.<br>
"See, Evelyn's been waiting a long time for this trip."<br>
"So?"<br>
"And she's older."<br>
"But I won."<br>
Now Mark placed both hands on Sam's shoulders. "Sam, I want you to put this into context," he said. "You're twelve. You're going to have other chances to come down the river. But Evelyn's fifty. This may be her only shot."<br>
"You said fifty wasn't old."<br>
Mark scratched his neck.<br>
"So she might have another chance," said Sam. "And I won," he reminded his father.<br>
Mark straightened up. "Just because you won doesn't mean you have to claim the prize. Right, Jill?"<br>
Jill felt herself seething inside. In a way she knew Mark was right, but in a larger way she thought that Sam had just as much right to the spot; and this feeling of hers had less to do with age and chance and more to do with simple filial loyalty, something Mark, she now saw, obviously found morally wrong.<br>
She repositioned the boy's baseball cap. "Well, Dad's got a point," she said, "but it's up to you. If you really want the spot, you can have it."<br>
Sam, sensing the cleft, crossed his arms.<br>
"But you know what would be the right thing to do," Mark added.<br>
He cast a dark look at Jill, and suddenly she found it impossible to censor herself. She nudged his arm--actually, batted it was more accurate--and stalked away from the group again.<br>
"Look at it from Evelyn's perspective," Mark said as he followed her. "She's not going to have unlimited chances to do this trip."<br>
"And Sam is?"<br>
"Sam only wants it because everyone else wants it."<br>
"Easy for you to say," said Jill, "you with your sure spot in the paddle boat."<br>
"Are you forgetting about last night? Someone puking in the tent?"<br>
Jill stopped. "What in god's name does that have to do with Sam giving up his seat?"<br>
"He could stand to be punished," Mark said.<br>
"Sam drinking and sam paddling Crystal have nothing to do with each other!"<br>
"The seat is a privilege. When you screw up, you lose some privileges. But put that aside for now. Mostly what I'm saying is, I think it means a whole lot more to Evelyn than it does to Sam."<br>
"And I care about Evelyn because why again?"<br>
"Grow up, Jill," said Mark, lowering his voice. "Be a parent for once. Say no to your kid. It's not going to kill him. In fact, a kid his age--"<br>
"Stop," Jill said, and she whipped around to face him. "This has nothing to do with age. It has nothing to do with Sam. It's really all about you, Mark, or haven't you noticed?"<br>
Mark looked skeptical, bemused. "Want to educate me here? Because I'm missing something."<br>
"Fuck you."<br>
"Hasn't happened lately," he remarked.<br>
"Oh FUCK you! FUCK YOU! And don't tell me you don't know what I mean! You know exactly what I mean! You're so caught up in looking good to others, Mark! You've got to be the good parent all the time, be the generous soul and teach your kids to do the same! Make them give half their Christmas presents to the shelter or pledge half their allowance to the church! Jesus, Mark, don't you ever want to be selfish?"<br>
"That's an interesting perspective on parenting."<br>
His calmness fueled her rage. Like he was above it all.<br>
"I mean, it all comes back, doesn't it?" he went on. "You give up something, and something else comes back to you? Isn't that what people call karma?"<br>
"You don't believe in karma, Mark; you're a Mormon."<br>
Mark laughed.<br>
"Laugh all you want. But I want you to know, I plan on enjoying myself a little more after this trip. You want to keep giving things up, fine. Give up alcohol. Give up skiing because your knee hurts. Why don't you give Evelyn your seat, if you think it means so much to her? Oh, because you didn't get drunk and therefore don't need to be punished?" She was rambling, and she hated rambling in an argument. especially with her levelheaded husband.<br>
"No," said Mark patiently. "Because kids ought to defer to adults. It's thoughtful. It's respectful. It's a nice thing to do. Now let's go back."<br>
"I'm not finished."<br>
Mark sighed. He took a nail clipper from his pocket and began to clip his nails. That did it. She snatched the nail clipper and threw it as far as she could out into the river--a quick sparkle in the air, then gone forever.<br>
But before she had a chance to enjoy any childish satisfaction, she looked over his shoulder and saw the rest of the group watching them. They all looked away quickly, but it was too late: they had seen everything; they had heard everything. Not only that, but as she stood there cringing about what she had revealed about herself and Mark and their marriage--as she stood there feelings just about as naked as she'd ever flet, she saw Sam walk over to Evelyn and begin gesturing.<br>
Mark headed back. Jill wanted to dig a hole and bury herself. She knew she should go back and help load up, but she couldn't face anyone, and so she stood on the sand, alone, as everybody else started loading up the boats. They could cut her some slack right now, she felt. Because inside she was still livid. All she wanted on this trip was for her family to break their routine, to grow and have fun and see themselves as more capable than they might have thought, back in salt Lake City.<br>
Was that really too much to ask for?<br>
After some time she saw JT heading toward her. Everybody else was in the boats. Ths is just too rich, she thought.<br>
"I'm fine," she told him.<br>
"Sam can paddle Lava, if he wants," he said.<br>
"I littered."<br>
"Huh?"<br>
"The nail clipper. I threw it in the river."<br>
"Oh. Well, it's not a huge deal."<br>
"I can go look for it. I can find it."<br>
"Actually, you probably can't. Don't worry about it."<br>
"Where's Sam?"<br>
"Dixie's boat."<br>
"I'm really, really sorry you had to witness this," she said.<br>
"Oh," said JT, "I've seen worse."<br>
He probably had. But it didn't make her feel any better.<br>
...It was fun; there was no doubt about it: for all his chatter about appreciating the smaller moments on a river trip, JT couldn't deny that sometimes a thirty-second thrill in big water could trump everything else.

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
During breakfast the next morning, JT told everyone to look for Ruth's pillbox, impressing on them the gravity of the situation. Ruth was no practicing Catholic, but she found herself saying a prayer to St. Anthony, patron saint of lost things.<br>
..."Sure looks like flesh-eating strep to me," [Ruth] declared when [JT] unwrapped the gauze. "In which case it won't matter if you evacuate us because I'll be dead by tonight. Might as well die down here where it's beautiful." She cringed at her sarcasm. She was acting like a sulky teenager. But she couldn't help it.<br>
"Lloyd will jump out of the helicopter if you try to evacuate us," she informed him.<br>
JT sat back. "Look, Ruth. I know it's your job to think about Lloyd. But it's my job to think about you and Lloyd and everyone else. I've got a trip to run. I'm liable for your health and safety."<br>
"I'll sign a release."<br>
"Ruth. I could lose my license over this. And do you really want to risk having your leg amputated? Who will take care of Lloyd if you're stuck in a wheelchair?"<br>
It seemed to Ruth that she had reached the very depths of despair, hearing this. She was damned if she stayed and damned if she went. But JT was right. As a responsible adult, she should be thinking of the long-term consequences of her actions.<br>
"I don't know how I'll tell Lloyd," she said.<br>
"If you want, I'll tell him," JT said. "I'll tell him i called my boss, and it's out of our control."<br>
"We'll miss Crystal and Lava," Ruth said.<br>
JT: You get your leg healed up and we'll find you space on another trip this summer.<br>
He'd gone too far, here; he'd lost his credibility, for they both knew another trip would never happen. But before she could call him on this--and make him feel twice as bad--they looked up to see Susan hurrying toward them.<br>
"It was under a towel in JT's boat," she said breathlessly, showing them the pillbox. "I got as many pills as i could find, but the rest were half dissolved. I don't know what's what." She handed it to Ruth. It had been gnawed ragged, and the pills that remained were all mixed up in the various compartments. Ruth dumped everything into the palm of her hand. Greedily she poked through them, separating out four of the oval tablets.<br>
"How many were there supposed to be?" JT asked her.<br>
"Ten."<br>
"Go back and look some more," JT ordered Susan. "Give me the pillbox. God damn it," and he held the pillbox in front of the dog's nose. The dog panted and wagged his tail.<br>
"You bad dog," JT said, "you bad, bad dog," and in a moment of temper, he swatted the dog's nose with the pillbox. Blender yelped and slunk away. "God damn it," said JT. He felt as close to waiting to punch something as he'd felt in a long, long time.<br>
Meanwhile, Ruth had already uncapped her water bottle and taken one of the pills.<br>
"You stop that, JT," she said, wiping her mouth. "We found the pills. Don't yell at the dog."<br>
"Four out of ten!"<br>
"Enough to get me started."<br>
"You can't just take half a course," he said.<br>
"I can when I'm on the river!" she said angrily. "Stop being such a gloomy Gus! I'm on antibiotics now! You're off the hook!"<br>
Sam came up, holding a few more pills, including another Cipro.<br>
"See?" said Ruth triumphantly. "Now we have five! You can't call for a helicopter when I have half the medicine I need! And who knows, we may find even more. Come," she ordered the dog, and he slunk around JT to sit at Ruth's side. He nuzzled her face and licked her neck.<br>
"He was just doing what a dog does," she told JT. "Now say you're sorry for smacking him. Come on," she said. "Say you're sorry."<br>
"I'm not."<br>
"Oh, but he is," she told the dog, smoothing his ears back. "He can't say it out loud, but he is."<br>
Without replying, JT set about re-dressing Ruth's wound, using the new bandage they'd gotten from the hikers. Ruth felt chastened by his silence. She wished he would say something. Was he still thinking of evacuation?<br>
It seemed not, because when he was finished wrapping her leg, he stood up and brushed the sand off his knees. "Let's get this show on the road," he shouted to the group. "I want everyone read to leave in ten minutes sharp! Pack it up!"<br>
He turned and offered her a hand. She pulled herself up and watched as he repacked the medical kit.<br>
"So...," she began.<br>
JT latched the kit. "No helicopter," he said flatly. "Not this morning, anyway."<br>
"Thank you," Ruth said meekly. JT shrugged and walked off. Ruth looked down at her leg.<br>
Heal, you old coot.

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
Late that night, while others slept, Evelyn headed upriver in the dark to find a good place to pee. Most people at night simply waded into the shallow water by the boats, but Evelyn felt too self-conscious with the guides so close by. And she wasn't going to punish herself over this anymore, either. She was who she was, and so what if she needed her privacy?<br>
... Once she and Julian had gone skinny-dipping in the ocean up in Maine. The moon was out, and Julian's little white rump bobbed in the surf. They were both afraid of getting caught, but it was early in their relationship, when they felt emboldened by love to commit risque acts.<br>
... Evelyn felt her stomach flutter. She didn't they had heard her, but all the same, she had witnessed them [making love]. Which was all that mattered here, because it seeded in her a yearning she thought she had disposed of when she dropped the necklace off Navajo Bridge. She flashed back to that night in Maine. She and Julian had been to scared to make love on the beach that night. But down here...<br>
For the rest of the trip, Evelyn kept imagining what it would be like, lying naked on the warm sand, with the sound of the river and a slight breeze and Julian between her legs, whispering terrible, lovely things in her ear.

Amy: Are you scared? What, are you a virgin or something?<br>
..."Oh, for Christ's sake. Fine," Peter said in a low voice. "It sucked."<br>
"Why?"<br>
"She cried."<br>
"I was too drunk to cry," she said. "Would you fuck a girl who was drunk?"<br>
"Jesus!"<br>
"Would you?"<br>
"What do you think?"<br>
Amy was silent.<br>
... [Peter] was definitely angry now--at himself, at Amy. He didn't want to be hearing any of this, yet he couldn't walk away.<br>
"What got you in such a pissy mood back there with Jill?"<br>
For the first time in all of this conversation, she turned and faced him. "Because you shouldn't go telling people you know what high school is like for me! You have no idea what high school is like for me!"

JT: Let's get a little coffee going. I'm sorry about this.<br>
Mark: It's not your fault [my adolescent sons drank alcohol]. These boys. I just don't know.<br>
JT: They're kids. I've seen much worse.<br>
Something about this comment caused Mark to bristle. "Actually, that doesn't really comfort me a whole lot," he said. "And I do think it's your fault, frankly."<br>
"Mark," Jill said.<br>
"You guys must have underage kids all the time on these trips," Mark said. "Haven't you figured out a way of monitoring things?"<br>
"He was dealing with Ruth's leg," Jill said.<br>
"Abo wasn't," said Mark. "Dixie wasn't."<br>
"I think I'll get the coffee going," JT said.<br>
"I'm just accepting his apology," said Mark when JT was gone.<br>
"You're being a jerk, Mark."<br>
"The boys are twelve and thirteen!"<br>
"I know how old our children are."<br>
"There's research now that says if you drink when you're that young, you're more likely to havve problems later."<br>
"It was one time, Mark."<br>
"Which can change your whole brain chemistry."<br>
Briefly Jill had the sickening feeling that because of this, the boys would in fact turn into alcoholics.<br>
..."Everyone does something like this at least once," Peter finally offered.<br>
This did not console Mark. "Are you Mormon?" he asked Peter.<br>
"No, sir," said Peter.<br>
"Then it doesn't matter what you did," said Mark. "Mormons aren't everyone."<br>
"Mark, please," said Jill.<br>
"Come on, Sam," said Mark, pulling the boy to his feet. Sam's arm was long and skinny, and his ribs showed. "A dunk in the water will help. You too, Matthew."<br>
When Mark and the boys were out of earshot, Jill apologized to Peter and Amy. "He tends to overreact."<br>
"So did my father," said Peter.<br>
This was a first for Jill, one of her children getting drunk, and she was eager for advice. "Did he ever lighten up?"<br>
"Well," said Peter, digging in his ear, pausing, "actually, he died when I was sixteen, so no."<br>
Jill felt the color rise in her neck, for making such a faux pas. "I'm sorry." Not knowing what else to say, she asked if his mother was still alive.<br>
"Yup."<br>
"Is she well?"<br>
Peter shrugged. "She has stomach ulcers and diabetes and high blood pressure, and she doesn't wear her compression stockings and won't even talk about selling the house, which was three floors and a huge garden out back full of peonies, which have to be watered daily, and guess whose job that is? Other than that, she's well."<br>
..."The thing is, my sister's kids go to a public school back east," [Jill] said. "They're sixteen and seventeen. My sister tells me stories. I worry that we've got some rough years ahead of us."<br>
Peter nodded knowingly. "Sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll."<br>
This did not comfort Jill.<br>
"Is it like that at your school, Amy?" she asked.<br>
Amy colored... without a word, Amy turned and lumbered away.<br>
... And [Jill] had to fix things with Mark too, so they wouldn't be blaming each other for this. You went off to shave. Well you went off and got drunk. Things like that: they didn't help in the short run or the long run.<br>
But he really was being a total shit.<br>
Amy's journal: I hate this trip. I hate these people. I hate my mother. I hate Peter, for thinking he knows me. Sex, drugs, and rock and roll? He was no clue.<br>
Everyone's eating dinner now. I hate food. I hate being fat. I hate my mother for always telling me I look fine the way I am. I never look fine.

"Have you seen the boys?" [Mark] asked.<br>
... "Well, they can't have gone very far." Jill said, trudging through the sand. "Did you check our tent?"<br>
"Why would they be in our tent?"<br>
"I don't know, Mark, maybe just because it's there?" Indeed, when they got to the tent, they heard hushed voices coming from inside.

Downstream a bit, over margaritas, Susan was telling Jill about her divorce.<br>
"Out of the blue," she said. "He didn't love me anymore. In fact he never loved me. He didn't want marriage counseling. He was filing papers the next day. Fifteen years," she said. "Just like that. Up in smoke."<br>
"Was it another woman?"<br>
"Of course. Though he denied it at the time. They always do. Then he married her."<br>
"Are they still married?"<br>
"Oh, they're a happy little Brady Bunch," said Susan. "They have a big happy house in Boston and go to Maine every summer."

JT settled back with a long sigh. "Someday, I'm going to fork out the big bucks and come down as a passenger," he said. "When the guides are fixing dinner, I'm going to sit and meditate. I'm going to write in a journal. I'm going to lie down in the back of an oar boat and ask the guide if these are sedimentary or metamorphic rocks."<br>
"You'd be bored shitless," said Abo.<br>
"Maybe it's getting time for me to be bored shitless."

JT: I'm not mad. I'm just worried about your leg, [Ruth]. And if we have to evacuate you, we'll have to evacuate Lloyd too.<br>
"Don't say that word," [Ruth] said angrily.<br>
JT: Ruth, I have to do what's right.<br>
Ruth: But you can't evacuate us! That wouldn't be right! It's our last trip! Do you know what it would do to Lloyd? Do you know? It would kill him. One helicopter ride, that's all it would take to erase everything.<br>
JT: But your leg. If it gets worse--<br>
Ruth: It's not going to get worse. We'll find the Cipro, and it'll get better. Stop thinking like that.<br>
JT: He needs you to be well.<br>
Ruth: He needs to stay on the river!<br>
JT: At the expense of your leg?<br>
Ruth: You're not listening. My leg is going to be fine.<br>
JT ran his fingers through his hair, and despite her anger, she felt a maternal protectiveness toward him. Of course he was worried. Of course he would be thinking about an evacuation. But he didn't know what it was like to be old, to be facing death square in the face, constantly aware of every event possibly being your last: your last Christmas, last time on an airplane, last trip down the river.<br>
She didn't fault him for not knowing this, but she wasn't going to allow the word "evacuate" to be spoken in any form down here in the canyon. Not in her tent, anyway. She scooted toward the door flap, then motioned for JT to go ahead of her.<br>
"Help me up," she said. He gave her his hand, and she pulled herself up.<br>
... "We've had a good marriage, JT," she said when he returned. "We've been good to each other."<br>
JT knelt and pulled on a pair of gloves. "Well," he said, wringing out a washcloth, "not many people can say that."<br>
"And I know what lies ahead." She winced as he dabbed at her leg. "I know it's not going to be pretty. I read the books. I go to the support groups. Sometimes I wish he'd just have a heart attack in the night."<br>
JT looked into Ruth's eyes. They were gray and lashless, but she had penciled a thin line across her upper lid and darkened her eyebrows; and he wondered if there was any other woman he knew, any friend, any lover, or any family member, who would take the time to do this on the river, at her age.<br>
"This trip is our last hurrah, JT," said Ruth. "I don't care if they have to amputate my leg when we get out. Just let us stay on the river."<br>
...Around and around the leg [JT] went with the gauze, thick, clean, and white, protection from all things terrible.

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
Ruth liked to think that theirs was a successful marriage. But it had always been a quiet marriage, one without a lot of shouting. Disputes were resolved mostly by the passage of time, as each came to understand, as if by osmosis, the other's position. Lord, accusatory fights made them both uncomfortable, for they knew that things said in the heat of an argument were often said more to inflict pain than to instill truth.<br>
But now, as she listened to Lloyd rant, she wondered if perhaps they'd been too reserved all this time. Maybe they should have occasionally had it out, as Becca would have put it when she was in college. Maybe they would have understood each other better.<br>
"What are you looking at?" [Lloyd] demanded.<br>
... "I'm looking at you, Lloyd," she sighed.<br>
"Oh." He seemed to contemplate this, and sending a window of opportunity, Ruth placed her palm against his cheek, for touch always seemed to bring him back to the present. His blooshot eyes skittered through the years.<br>

JT was recommending a liter every four hours: Evelyn decided she could halve that amount without running any health risks.<br>
It was the simplest of equations:<br>
J - B = E<br>
Where J = the amount of water JT was recommending;<br>
B = the amount of water that would ordinarily end up in her bladder; and<br>
E = the amount of water that she, Evelyn, would have to drink to stay sufficiently hydrated.<br>
... A spasm of loneliness gripped Evelyn right then. She suddenly wished, with all her heart, that she had urged Julian to come after all. There was nobody with whom she was feeling a real kindship, she was a fifth wheel, unintegrated, both superior and inferior to everyone.<br>
How did you express that, mathematically?

Mitchell: I'm just consuling a map is all.<br>
JT: Well, consult all you want. There's no way to get to Phantom from here.<br>
Mitchell: Then what do you propose to do with the dog?<br>
JT: That's easy, the dog's on for the duration.<br>
Mitchell expelled a little puff of air.<br>
Mitchell: What about Hermit? ... A response would be in order.<br>
Realizing that they were halfway through their journey and that it was time to level with Mitchell, JT drew him aside. For once, he took off his own glasses, because even though the bright noonday sun burned his retinas, he wanted Mitchell to look straight into his eyes.<br>
Mitchell: What do you have against me, anyway? You've had it in for me from the start. Are you going to spell it out or just keep pissing me off?<br>
JT: Shut up, Mitchell.<br>
To his surprise, Mitchell fell silent.<br>
JT: Okay now, you've got two options, Mitchell. One, you can stay with us, or two, you can find another for the next seven days. That's pretty simple, don't you think, Mitchell? Now I suspect the last thing you want to do at this point is take any advice from me, but I'm your Trip Leader, and that's my job, and so I'm going to advise you to choose option number one and stick with us. And you know why? Because if you don't, you're going to look back on this as the biggest missed opportunity of your life. Because it's not about the dog, Mitchell. It's about learning to let go. ... And if you stay with us, I promise you two things. Number one, forget about the allergies. Lena's not going to go into anaplhylactic shock, unless she cuddles up with the dog, which I don't think she's inclined to do... Stay with me, Mitchell, because here comes promise number two: I guarantee you that book you're writing is going to be a hell of a lot better with a dog than without. Are you with me here? Think about the opportunities, Mitchell. What would John Wesley Powell have done? You think he would have ditched the dog? ... Hardly a question you really have to ask. Now grow up, Mitchell, and let yourself have some fun. Don't take this trip so seriously. Kid around. Be nice. People want to like you, Mitchell. They really do.

If he didn't wake up from this? If he wasn't here tomorrow, no matter. Well, even with the mystery of what may happen next, no matter. For I know he'd be there for me, in some safe celestial place.

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
JT had just enough time to pull into the small camp below the eddy. Once they hit shore, he yanked free a sleeping pad, tossed it into the water, flopped on top of it, and paddled out to get the dog--who, after all of this, still held the stick clenched in his teeth. His nostrils flared, and his dark eyes regarded JT with an immense sense of calm, as though JT were completely, unquestionably in tune with him, about things in general but specifically about this sixteen-inch stick, which was, as JT must know, the be-all and end-all of life itself; so that when JT grabbed hold of the dog's bandanna and paddled back to the beach and the dog felt solid ground under his feet, he did not run about and sniff, or dance for JT's approval, but rather sat himself upon the sand, head high, stick in mouth, proud of a job well done.<br>
... "You don't need to do that," said JT.<br>
"By golly," said Mark, "he can't keep himself out of trouble."<br>
"He did what any kid would do," said JT, who hated to see people punished (unless by his own doing) on one of his trips. Still, he didn't like to go against parents' directives, either.
	</p>

	<p id="1380">
From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
As with most flips, there was no time for dismay; JT went straight into rescue mode, scanning the surface for life jackets. Within seconds, everyone popped up right next to the paddle boat--everyone but Peter, that is, Peter who couldn't swim, and while the others (amid mass confusion) managed to haul themselves onto the slick upturned belly of the raft, JT watched--now with dismay--as Peter got swept down through the rest of Hance and straight into Son-of-Hance, a second wash cycle, as it were, and except for a foot that kept poking up here and there, JT saw no sign of the young man, which didn't really concern him at first, but the seconds kept ticking by, so he was very, very glad when Peter finally resurfaced in the tailwaves, wearing the stunned look of someone who's fallen off a fifty-foot cliff and against all odds not only survived but found his skeletal system intact. JT rowed hard to intercept Peter before the river carried him even farther downstream to Sockdolager Rapid, and when he did haul the young man out of the water, it took a great deal of effort to convince a teethchattering Peter that he was still alive, that the life jacket had done its trick and the white light he'd seen while submerged was not the doorway to heaven but the color of the sky as viewed from inside a sea of bubbles by someone in a state of shock.<br>
... But JT was, in his core, an optimist by nature, and he reminded himself that a flip and a bit of squabbling was just that, nothing more. Things like this happened all the time. You couldn't be a river guide and see the glass as half empty. Shit happened. It was part of the journey. And so when he felt they'd had enough time to warm up, he called everyone back to the boats, and they headed out once again.<br>
For JT, it was simply yet another morning adventure on the river. But for the thinking travelers, something had shifted. As they floated deeper into the gorge, several of them experienced the sense that they were no longer on the same river--that the canyon, for all its beauty, had begun to menace in a way it hadn't before. The current ran more swiftly, and the walls that towered above could have been forged from a different planet. Gone were the sunny stair-stepping sandstone cliffs; in their place rose more than five hunded vertical feet of glistening black schist, shot through with lightning forks of pink granite. It was dark down here, and it was violent too, and the violence had an inexplicable permanence to it, one that was going to take them some time, as novice travelers, to figure out.<br>
... In fact, it wasn't long before Dixie captured the interest of a ragtag couple laden with army-surplus gear--the neddiest having the kindest of hearts, JT thought.

Also, JT had overheard everything between Mark and Jill back at the Little Colorado. He had watched his share of marriages disintegrate during these trips; the canyon could strip the veneer off a marriage, make placid people restless, suddenly aware of imperfections. Just as you could fall in love at the drop of a hat, so too you could fall out of love. He hoped this wasn't going to happen with Mark and Jill.
	</p>

	<p id="1378">

Nor would it hurt Mark to go a day without sit-ups. Mark at forty had done well over two hundred thousand sit-ups: fifty per day, three hundred sixty-five days a year, for at least the fourteen years they had been married. At home he did them in their bedroom upson rising. Here he did them on the sand, in the darkness, after everyone had gone to bed. Jill was grateful to have married someone who wasn't going to let himself go, but she found herself wondering, as she lay on her sleeping mat listening to Mark's little grunts, if he would really develop a set of the dreaded love handles in fourteen days. And so what if he did? The world wouldn't come to an end, she wanted to tell him. She would still love him.

[JT had] guided four or five trips with [Ruth and Lloyd] over the years and knew that if any two people depended on the river for their soul and sustenance, it was this couple from Evanston, Illinois.<br>
... All [JT] asked was that people be straight with him.<br>
... Thus JT found himself rowing with Mitchell and Lena that fourth morning. And he was glad it had worked out this way, because in his heart, he liked to think that beneath the surface of every pain in the ass was a well-intentioned individual who could probably shed light on some topic that JT had always been wondering about.<br>
... Lena: 'Mitchell, when are you going to write the darn thing?'<br>
"That's an ambitious project," said JT.<br>
"Well, you gotta have a project when you're retired. What about you boatmen? Do you ever retire?"<br>
This was a question JT could easily answer. Some of his friends sstopped guiding when they had families or simply left the river in search of a steady income. Others developed back or shoulder problems. But some kept rowing well into their seventies--wooden dories, rafts, kayaks, whatever they could get their hands on, because keeping them out of the canyon was like keeping them away from food or water.<br>
JT didn't know if he would be one of the old-timers or not. In fact his son Colin, a lawyer with a Phoenix firm, had begun pressing JT to retire from the river. "You're fifty-two, Dad. Get a real job. You need medical benefits, you need a retirement plan." JT would point out that a retirement plan wasn't going to do him much good starting at this late date. "Doesn't matter," said Colin. "You shouldn't be lifting coolers in and out of boats. Who's going to take care of you when you need back surgery? Or when that hernia you've been complaining about starts hollering for some attention?"<br>
JT was moved that Colin was looking out for him, but he suspected that Colin always wished he'd had a more traditional kind of father, not someone who was perfectly happy to fill in with some carpentry during the winter while waiting for the river corridor to open up in April.<br>
"Some of us retire," he told Mitchell now. "Some of us will never leave, though."<br>
"And which are you?"<br>
JT grinned. "Haven't figured it out yet."<br>
"Do you ever get tired of it?" asked Lena.<br>
"Oh," said JT, "maybe there'll be a trip in October that seems to last too long. But generally, no. If I ever get to the point where I feel like I'm shuttling people back and forth, then I'll retire. I'm not there yet."

"Speaking of dead bodies," Peter said. "How many times have you flipped? Be honest."<br>
Abo tipped his head back and roared with laughter, then suddenly went solemn. "Three."<br>
"Dixie?"<br>
Dixie, tending the battered fire pan, sat back on her heels, which were gray and leathery and riddled with cracks. "There are two types of river guides, Peter," she said. "Those who've flipped, and those who will."<br>
"Which are you?"<br>
"You'll have to figure that out yourself," she said. "Evelyn, you ready with the batter?"<br>
Evelyn knelt beside Dixie and tilted the mixing bowl so Dixie could scrape the cake batter into the great iron Dutch oven.<br>
"I'd like to flip, just to see what everyone's talking about," Amy said.<br>
"Ride with Abo," said Dixie with a grunt as she hoisted the Dutch oven over the bed of coals. Evelyn offered to wash the bowl.<br>
"Leave it for Abo," said Dixie.<br>
"Leave it for JT, you mean," said Abo.<br>
Who at that moment came over lugging a full jug of water.<br>
"I'm taking a survey," Peter said "How many times have you flipped?"<br>
JT set the jug on the drink table. The corners of his eyes crinkled. "Why're you asking?"<br>
"I'm trying to figure out the safest boat to ride in."<br>
"Not mine," said Dixie.<br>
"Or mine," said Abo.<br>
"Definitely not mine," said JT.<br>
They were all joking, and Evelyn knew that, but joking was one thing she had never been very good at. She wished right now that she could say something that would make them all laugh, and admire her and want to ride with her tomorrow.

Every single time, she had to wait until they were on shore; not only that, but instead of feeling more comfortable with the group as the days went on, she felt less so, and she was finding it necessary to trek farther and farther away, just for the fiction of privacy. What was wrong with her? Why, having done so many backpacking trips with large groups of people, was she suddenly so shy?<br>
... It was a complicated breakup. When it happened, Julian cried. But he said that Evelyn couldn't give him what he wanted in life, which was a partner who wanted to be just that, a partner, someone who shared his interests and wanted to actually do things together, not someone who was satisfied to simply come home at night after a day spent pursuing separate activities. Evelyn liked to canoe; Julian liked to go to a ball game. Evelyn liked bird-watching; Julian liked reading the sports page and puttering in the garage. There was very little they liked to do together, and although he loved her, at fifty-seven, he felt there was someone out there who could offer him more companionship. Evelyn, for her part, didn't see anything wrong with two people who loved each other pursuing their own separate interests. In fact, she thought it showed a smothering lack of independence when other couples did everything together.<br>
"Lots of people take separate vacations," she argued. "It doesn't mean they don't love each other."<br>
"But I don't want to take separate vacations," Julian said. "I want someone to go up to Ogunquit with."<br>
"But I'm tired of going to your family cottage."<br>
"Exactly," Julian said.<br>
In the end, she felt too proud to argue with him. If he wanted to find someone else, let him find someone else. She didn't want to stand in his way. But she missed him. They had never moved in together--Julian owned a house in Brookline, Evelyn a flat in Cambridge--but her place seemed empty and quiet without Julian. The batteries in the remote corroded from lack of use. The sports page went straight into recycling. She stopped buying beer to have on hand. She spent way too much time perusing catalogues and eating bagged salad.<br>
... Evelyn thought poorly of people who didn't pitch in. From an early age, she'd been taught to look around and see what needed to be done.

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
When [Peter's] girlfriend broke off their relationship last fall after six long years together, nobody was more suprised than Peter. The news came out of nowhere: not only did she not love him anymore, but she had fallen in love with someone else, an insurance agent who drove a Mercedes-Benz and owned a lakefront time-share. A lovable insurance agent? Wasn't that an oxymoron?<br>
Peter didn't get how something like this could happen, how one person could fall out of love without the other person suspecting anthing. The words "clueless chump" ran like a news banner beneath his dreams, all night, ever night. How had he missed the signs? There was the vacation with her girlfriends last summer, the many late nights with her book club, the mascara she wore when she went to the gym. (It turned out that was where they met: on the StairMaster! How cliched, how... common! He imagined her not knowing how to access the TV channel, and there was John D. Rockefeller, ready to help.) Now they were married, living on a cul-de-sac, where from the looks of all the stray plastic toys littering the yards someone was definitely pumping fertility drugs into the water supply.<br>
... But the boat was already angling left, with lateral waves dousing both sides, and Peter, with an instinct he didn't know he had, plunged his paddle down behind his hips, plunged it deep and then pivoted back using all his weight, all 186 pounds, rock hard abs, he was a Viking, Poseidon, Neptune, he was moving oceans.<br>
... "Just watch Peter. Way to put some mojo into things!"<br>
But Peter wasn't listening. Ten feet away, Dixie was applying Chapstick. She rubbed her lips together, then tucked the ChapStick back into the pocket of her shorts. Peter licked his own lips. They were dry. Would it be out of line to ask to borrow her ChapStick?<br>
You are so lame, he told himself.<br>
Look. ChapStick. Right in your own pocket.<br>
It was the saddest thought he'd had all day.

"What'd the ranger say?" Mitchell asked after JT hung up.<br>
"He's got other things to deal with, Mitchell."<br>
Mitchell nodded, reflecting on this for a moment. "Well," he said, "I guess we just roll with the punches."<br>
"That's right, Mitchell."<br>
"You sound tired."<br>
"Nah." Though he was.<br>
"Don't worry," said Mitchell, and he leaned forward and clapped JT's arm. "We'll figure this one out."<br>
JT glanced up. Mitchell's large dark glasses made it impossible to see the man's eyes, but JT could hear in his voice a concern for others that surprised him.<br>
"Thank you, Mitchell," said JT. "Did you get enough lunch?"<br>
"It was terrific. You guys are doing a terrific job."<br>
JT managed a smile. He did a little better with private compliments but still felt bashful.

When they'd left camp, they'd been in deep shade, but soon a rich golden wedge of sunlight slid across the river, drenching them in its liquid heat.<br>
Riding in the back of JT's boat, Ruth Frankel lifted her face to the sun. She was amused by their unexpected guest; she had learned long ago that a large part of the canyon experience was dealing with the unexpected. And if the unexpected happened to take the form of a friendly lost dog--well, thought Ruth, worse things could happen.<br>
... [Lloyd's] lips were chapped, and crusty bits collected in the corners of his mouth. Thank goodness we came, [Ruth] thought. How awful to have stayed home in Evanston, waiting for him to forget to breathe. [Lloyd has Alzeihmer's.]<br>
Lloyd held the water bottle for [Ruth], and she drank again, still tasting blood. [Ruth] hated being the center of attention, especially for an injury. Whatever it was, it would stop bleeding. It would heal. They shouldn't be fussing over here. She was wasting everyone's time when they should be enjoying lunch.<br>
... JT lifted the gauze. It wasn't a clean split but rather a raw, messy wound. She saw grit and pink flesh, then a sudden flush of blood. JT pressed the gauze back. Ruth, who had tended to many cuts and abrasions while raising two children, reminded herself that wounds could look more serious than they really were. There was just a lot of blood here. They would clean it and bandage it up, and she would be fine.<br>
She had to be fine.<br>
Because if she wasn't, who would take care of Lloyd?

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
JT was leery of naming the dog, but people are driven to name things--especially on a river trip, where you have a lot of time to contemplate things you normally wouldn't.<br>
... [Jill] felt like a lot of things that mattered two days ago no longer mattered. Fleetingly, she wished that she were on this trip without her family.<br>
... Abo shot [Dixie] a wounded look and reached out and caught the dog by the scruff of its neck. "Such a meanie," he crooned. "What's your name, anyway? What do they call you?"<br>
JT set his plate on the sand, and as the dog licked the remains, JT knotted red bandanna around the dog's neck. "You know what they say," he said.<br>
"What?"<br>
But JT didn't answer. Dog or no dog, he still had a trip to run. Time to clean up. Time to break camp. Time to load up the boats, and make room for the dog. If there was anything JT liked, it was a first, and this was definitely his first trip with a dog.<br>
You name it, you love it, was what he was going to say to Abo, but JT didn't dare articulate the truism, even to himself.<br>
... "Until we can figure something else out," JT continued. "It's not exactly what we expected, but hey, this is the river, gotta be flexible, right?"

Amy's journal [250lb 17-year old]: We found a dog tonight. Some people are freaking out but I don't see what the big deal is. I fed him a lot of salmon so he will like me. Maybe I can mke him FAT and then I will have something in common with someone else.

Very few things could rattle JT, which was why he was such a good river guide: he handled the unforeseen with grace, and usually managed to learn something from it and come out ahead.<br>
... But so what if [Amy, the 250 lb 17 year old], didn't hike as much as the others? The canyon belonged to everyone, regardless of physical limitations. She would still have a good time. And who knew what she might learn about herself?<br>
This was, in fact, what [JT] enjoyed about these trips: watching people discover new sides of themselves on the river. The fearful took risks; the quiet ones opened up; sometimes (though not always), the loud ones quieted down. Egos got checked, life plans altered. You saw a lot of Plan Bs develop on a river trip.

Once on the beach, JT squatted and set the dog on the sand. The two boys fell upon him before either parent could stop them, tussling his ears and trying to rub his belly, and the dog, who knew a good thing when he saw it, forgot about the thorn and happily rolled onto his back and splayed his legs, as though reuniting with his long-lost family.

[Jill had] gotten drenched, but oddly, she wasn't at all cold; within minutes the sun had dried her arms and legs, and she was grateful now not to have a shirt on because the sun felt so good. She looked at Mark and Mark looked at her, and they both laughed out loud, something they hadn't done in years together, and she glanced back and witnessed a miracle, namely, that the boys weren't fighting and in fact had wide horsey grins on their faces, and she would never have said this out loud but she thought: Didn't I say you would love it? Now, aren't you glad you're here?<br>
Truly, she told herself. Keep your mouth shut.

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
Later, [Ruth and Lloyd] moved to Evanston, Illinois. where they raised their two children, but they returned year after year for two weeks in the canyon. They brought friends. They passed up ski vacations and trips to Mexico to save their money for this particular trip; one year, when both children were in college, they traded Ruth's paintings in exchange for their fare. Didn't they get tired of the same old trip? people would ask. Didn't they want to see other places? The truth was, they both felt a renewal of the soul while on the river, something that their friends in Evanston--churchgoers all--failed to comprehend.<br>
And then, two years ago, at the age of seventy-four, Lloyed began forgetting things. What he'd had for breakfast. What they'd done last weekend. Examining a patient, he found himself repeating his questions, and then he'd go back to his office and find he couldn't remember what he'd just diagnosed. Ruth didn't need a doctor to tell her what was wrong. Last year Lloyd's condition was not so advanced, and they took their river trip as usual, without worry. This year, however, the increasing memory lapses and confusion had left Ruth debating the wisdom of a river trip. Was it irresponsible to take Lloyd? Alone, she visited Lloyd's doctor and asked for his advice. He was an old friend and understood the spiritual significance of these trips for Ruth and Lloyd, and he listened to Ruth ticking off the worrisome incidents with a somber but skeptical demeanor. When she finished, he leaned across his desk and clasped her hands.<br>
"Ruth," he said, "you're a cautious, responsible woman. Go. You'll take good care of him. It will do more for his spirit than keeping him safe in his living room."<br>
So she'd signed them up for what she knew, deep in her heart, would be their last trip together. The hardest part was getting them both packed, because Lloyd kept forgetting that he was going on any trip at all, let alone a two-week journey through the Grand Canyon. Upstairs in their comfortable colonial, Ruth laid out piles of clothes she intended to pack, and Lloyd would wander in and see them there all nice and fresh on the guest room bed and put them on and go out into the garden and stand with his hands on his hips. Ruth bought extra Metamucil biscuits and Lloyd ate them. She bought six tubes of suncreen, only to have them disappear. At one point she lost her temper, shrieking that she was going to put him in a nursing home and go alone. But Lloyd just replied, "Go where?" and she cried all night, unable to forgive herself.

From In the Heart of the Canyon by Elisabeth Hyde<br>
At the lunch buffet that day, Susan Van Doren was so conscious of people staring at her daughter that she almost confronted them head-on. Had none of them ever been fat? Had a fat friend? Watched the scaled go up up up regardless of what they ate?<br>
Get over it, Susan, said the Mother Bitch. Face it; your duaghter's fat because she eats like a horse. And she eats like a horse because you're neurotic about your weight. You drink diet everything. You weigh yourself every morning. For seventeen years, you've communicated your own obsession to her, and now look: two hundred and fifty pounds of maternal fault.<br>
... On her personal information form, Susan had written that her goal for the trip was to learn something new about herself. Amy, she'd noted before mailing off the packet, had written that her goal was "to meet people who share a passion for the wilderness and anything outdoorsy and to see the Grand Canyon and above all to have fun :)"<br>
Who could find fault with a girl like that?<br>
... What kind of mother brought an overweight teenage girl on a trip where you lived in a bathing suit?<br>
... [Amy's] really a caring, sensitive, thoughtful person, Susan wanted to tell the others. And really, what were a few cookies, in the grand scheme of things? Nevertheless, she worried that the others might not only judge her for the excess calories, but think she was eating more than her fair share. And Susan thought bitterly, once again, how unfair it was, the way people prejudged overweight people. This time she didn't give the Mother Bitch any chance whatsoever to come back with her snide, fault-finding remarks, but rather stuffed the old hag back into her sack and tied it shut with a double knot.

In fact, if [Evelyn] closed her eyes, she could have even been back in Boston. She thought of the man who'd left her six months ago with the briefest of letters, whose golden heart she still wore around her neck. She reached up and fingered the heart. It was smooth and warm, as familiar as a tooth. She recalled its red velvet box, the white satin inside. She remembered the touch of his bearded chin against her chest, how he bumbled with his glasses before they made love.<br>
Suddenly, on a whim, Evelyn reached up and unfasted the chain. Dangling it over the railing, she pictured his face once more, then let go. Golden threads in midair, the heavier heart glinting below--Julian's gift evaporated in the hot desert air. And with it, she hoped, any gloom that was trying to seep in and ruin her trip.

And so it was, more than just a few times in [JT's] life as a guide, and although there were always a few who subswquently wanted off, now, what made it all worthwhile was seeing the expressions on the others' faces as he hauled them up onto the upturned belly of his raft--expressions of shock, adrenaline, joy, fear, joy, excitement, and did he mention joy? Because that's what it was, usually: the sheer exultation of surviving a swim in one of the most powerful rivers on earth.<br>
... There were two kids, which pleased him; kids usually brought a goofy spirit absend in adults, who too easiily fell victim to excessive reverence for natural wonders. He made a mental note to assign the boys a job--can-smasher, maybe--so they could feel useful and independent from their parents.<br>
... That evening, as the sky grew dark, boaters from all the groups gathered together and passed around a bottle of whiskey, sharing old stories, inventing new ones.

Down in the heart of the canyon, in the bone-baking heat, they put their lives on hold.<br>
...JT, the head guide, had seen it all before. This being his 125th trip down the Colorado River, he'd witnessed time and again the universal zombielike walk of his guests at the end of the day when they staggered up the beach in search of a campsite. He called it the Death Walk and always reminded his fellow guides not to expect much volunteer help in the first few days of any July trip, as guests acclimated to the suffocating conditions of the Grand Canyon. It was simply a matter of physiology: the human body wasn't designed to go from a comfortable air-conditioned existence to the prehistoric inferno of canyon life in a day. When his heat-stomped campers marveled at his energy, he kept at what he was doing and raised an eyebrow and said, "You'll adjust."<br>
JT was a man of few words.<br>
... But in fact he was all three. JT Maroneys heart was in those walls, and had been since his first trip thirty-five years ago when someone handed him a life jacket and a paddle and said, "Are you coming or not?" It was in the polished maroon cliffs of Marble Canyon, the dusty tan layers of Coconino sandstone; it was embedded forever in the shimmering black walls of the Inner Gorge, Land of the Giants. It was in the scorpions and the velvet wasps and the stinging red ants that sent you running for a vial of ammonia; it was in the feathery tamarisk trees and the canyon wrens' falling notes and the grumpy black-winged California condor he spotted without fail as they passed under Navajo Bridge the first day of every trip. It was in the tug of water around his ankle as he splashed about, rigging his boat; it was in the sunlit droplets that danced above the roar of big water.<br>
Each trip changed him a little. This trip would change him a lot. It would change everyone, in ways no one could have anticipated.<br>
But on the Fourth of July, at the beginning of JT's 125th trip, it wasn't about change. It was about drinking beer and eating pie and dreaming up new ways to fly the Stars and Stripes over the grandest river in the West.

From James Baldwin<br>
I'll tell you this: when I left this country in 1948, I left this country for one reason only. One reason. I didn't care where I went, I might have gone to Hong Kong, I might have gone to Timbuktu, ended up in Paris, on the street of Paris with forty dollars in my pocket with the theory that nothing worse could happen to me there that had already happened to me here. You talk about making it as an a writer by yourself. You have to be able then to turn on all the antennas on which you live because once you turn your back on this society, you may die. You may die. And it's very hard to sit at a typewriter and concentrate on that if you're afraid of the world around you. The years I lived in Paris did one thing for me: they released me from that particular social terror, which is not the paranoia of my own mind, but a real social danger visible in the face of every cop, every boss. Everbody. I don't know what most white people in this country feel. I can only conclude what they feel from the state of their institutions. I don't know if white Christians hate Negroes or not, but I know that we have Christian church that is white and a Christian church which is black. I know as Malcolm X once put it: it's the most decorated hour in American life is high noon on Sunday. And so it's a great deal for me about a Christian nation. It means I can't afford to trust most white Christians and certainly cannot trust the Christian church. I don't know whether the labor unions and their bosses really hate me. That doesn't matter. But I know I'm not in their unions. I don't know if the real estate lobby has anything against black people, but I know the real estate lobbies keep me in the ghetto. I don't know if the board of education hates black people, but I know the textbooks they give my children to read and the schools that we have to go to. Now this is the evidence. You want me to make an act of faith, risking myself, my life, my woman, my sister, my children on some idealism which you assure me exists in America, which I have never seen.

Standing in the shower, I felt as though twenty years had been erased, washed off me, as if I emerged eighteen again, an unsettling feeling compounded by the fact that Natalia had taken the girls for a walk around the neighborhood of Victorian houses and cobblestone streets, no sound of the family I'd made, it was all a dream, my mom typing something in her study, letting the machine pick up the landline when it rang, my dad gone to Dillon's for a quick shopping, whole milk and macaroni, organic if they have it, etc.

He typed out fragments of what his dad had said, but now he organized and broke them roughly according to their syllables and stresses, something he'd been experimenting with in his poems:<br>
It's painful when you clear the air<br>
I haven't always lived up to<br>
Especially when there is so much<br>
A process view of change becomes<br>
Two layers of light gray or gold<br>
Electricity beneath your palm<br>
And so on. There was some kind of special power involved in repurposing language, redistributing the voices, changing the principle of patterning, faint sparks of alternative meaning in the shadow of the original sense, the narrative. The power was both real and very weak, a distant signal. He wrote a few more tercets, none of them particularly good, but the process of composing them, or letting some other force compose them through him, relaxed him a little, a kind of meditation.

"You're most likely familiar with the character of one Wile E. Coyote and his nemesis, the Road Runner." His tone is crisp, slightly heightened; Evanson is a talented actor acting natural. He raises both arms, opens them out, a gesture that indicates confidence, welcome, that he has nothing to hide. "Again and again, Wile E. Coyote attempts to capture the swift if flightless bird"--such easily accessible but somewhat literary phrasing was a signature of Evanson's, would become one of Adam's--"often through absurdly complicated means. In a great many of these cartoons, after a mad pursuit of the Road Runner, Wile. E. ends up running off a cliff. Instead of immediately falling, however, Wile E. is suspended in midair, briefly oblivious to his predicament." What teenager spoke this way, let alone about a cartoon? "It is only when the coyote looks down and realizes his position"--Evanson slowly lifts a hand into the air--"that he plummets." The hand drops dramatically. "Ladies and gentlemen"--a pause in which tension gathers--"on November ninth of last year, state socialism looked down."

Pamela: Having scuba-dived myself, I haven't read about scuba diving and the terrors of it and had such a visceral reaction. She writes exactly the way it felt to me, which is to say: deeply, deeply unsettling. Scuba diving is another thing that the more you know, the less you want to be a part of it. It's not like being fully informed makes it any less frightening. It's scarier. It's not like flying in an airplane, for example. One of the ways people calm you down when you're scared of flying is to give you all the information... you learn more about scuba diving and the more you know, just the more you're like, this is not meant to be.

Joy Ladin: Transgender experience is human experience because it's a normal human thing for us to run away from living aspects of ourselves that make us different... People on a message board said, "You know, when you come out, everybody will tell you how brave you are." And he said: "It doesn't take much courage to run out of a burning house."... I realized two things: it does take courage to run out of a burning house. Human beings are amazing survivors and sometimes, our ability to survive and adapt to what's killing us is self-destructive. When people told me I was so brave, and I considered it cowardice: forty something years I spent in the burning house didn't strike me as courage there. I realized that they were recognizing in me the courage that they couldn't recognize in themselves. And I did start saying to people that any courage or strength that they're seeing in me is a projection: you're seeing the courage it takes you to be the human being you want to be. Because I've never met any human being that didn't need courage to live their lives.

David Greene: The world is not so black and white. The thing that sticks out with me with Anakin Skywalker is that, as we now know, he was so close to being good. It's not like you are born evil. But once you get angry, once you are driven into a dark place, it can be hard to turn back. I think about how people were drawn into nazism and the holocaust, good people, families who loved their neighbors and then were suddenly taken by a movement and made to feel angry, and made to feel like they had to do something terrible to protect themselves. Once you go down that road, you can do vicious vicious things.<br>
Host: The idea that this force is in all of us, it's everywhere, connecting us to one another. But that you can very easily be Darth Vader or you can be Luke Skywalker. You can go either one. And it's a thin line. It's not as far away from you than you think. It's always living within you. That's such a strong message to convey because it allows us to have empathy for people who you never think you would.

From On Being with Pauline Boss<br>
Client: Oh, you mean the situation is crazy, not me.<br>
Pauline: That's exactly what I mean. It's an illogical, chaotic, unbelievably painful situation that these people go through who have missing loved ones either physically or psychologically. If they have some symptoms of grief that carry on, lets say even for 5 or 10 years, if it's a caregiver of an Alzeihmer's patient or the parent of a missing child, there is nothing wrong with them. That is typical. That is to be expected--that they would grieve along the way for the various things that they are missing. For example, if a child is kidnapped, they might have an extra grief when this child's friends are graduating or when this child's friends are marrying or having their first job or going away for college. So the grief is long term, it's chronic grief.<br>
Krista: I worked on an Alzeimer's ward, and I remember watching people come to see their loved one: their spouse, their grandmother, their sister. I remember, as this person who just wandered in, and who was supposed to care about people and care for them, I would be so impatient with how people would be so upset when they came in and this person didn't remember their name. And over time, I got so much more compassionate about that because I realized that the stress, the difficulty, because it was like an incremental death. Every time they came, a little more gone, and yet, it's this person who looks the same. It is this monumental struggle for people to be peaceful about this reality and have it so that love is there and not there and really needing them to remember their name, to know who they were, to say that there's this incredible pain associated with it. It was reasonable but it was so out of sync with the unreasonability.

Joy Ladin: Jonah is a prophet. We think of it as a glamorous job, it's really not a glamorous job in the ancient world. If you're a prophet, the odds are you're gonna say things that make the people in power very unhappy. And so you're often the target of violence and harassment. So Jonah is a prophet, it's what he's made to do. But he doesn't want to be what he's made to be. And he runs away from being what he's made to be even when he is about to die. He still doesn't want to say, alright, I'll be what I'm to be. And this was my life story as a trans-person. I didn't want to have to live my trans-identity. I couldn't imagine any good coming from it. Why do I have to be that guy, walking around being a spectacle, saying the stuff nobody wants to hear? Why do that? Like Jonah, I tried to go to sleep spiritually, be disassociative, don't feel, just get through. Don't try to live, just try to get through life. And it'll land eventually. And when that doesn't work, like Jonah, my great idea was not becoming who I really was, not living the life that I had to live, it was: I will kill myself for the sake of others. And there are a lot of queer people who feel the same way: the world doesn't want us to be who we are. People we love are angry or ashamed, they don't want to see us. So we'll do everyone a favor by dying, by killing ourselves, we'll just take ourselves out of the picture.

Sima just listened; I wish i could express to you how wonderfully Sima handled silence, how she calibrated it, how she somehow made you feel heard, met you wherever you were--maybe all these expressions seem cliched to you, but you know, I think you sometimes have it, too, that ability, when you're not in debate mode. She just sat there smiling that very beautiful and also very sad and understanding smile and what she did, in part by doing nothing, was let me hear how my upset was not self-evident, how my rage at my mom's failure to "protect" you from the video or my rage that stealing the painting was to her mind the worst thing she'd ever done had not yet been integrated into a coherent narrative. Sima made a space for me to heat that there were depths beneath what I was saying that I hadn't sounded yet.<br>
... And [Grandma] took Deborah and she left me alone with my father, which is the worst thing she ever did. And then at some point my speech just wasn't sustainable as speech at all; I dissolved into sobs, sobbing overtook me. I didn't see it coming, it was as involuntary and shocking as a muscle spasm. At first I was kind of laughing at the sobbing, sun and rain, laughing involuntarily at the force and unexpectedness of it, and then I gave in to it entirely. There was this incredible sense of relief when I let go: this language has ended in pure sound. This language has reached its limit, and a new one will be built, Sima and I will build it. I remember looking through my tears at Sima and seeing that she was not coming to me, that she was sitting there--now upright, very poised--full of sympathy, but that she was not going to approach and hug or hold me, and I thought--how strange that I could think anything at all--that she was right to sit up, to stay there, to wait; I remember thinking that we had started therapy.

Pauline: I think it hits our psyche deeply. We come from culture in this country of, I think, mastery orientation. We like to solve problems. We're not comfortable with unanswered questions and this is full of unanswered questions. These are losses minus facts. Somebody's gone: you don't know where they are. You don't know if they are alive or dead. You don't know if they are coming back. So that kind of mystery gives us a feeling of helplessness that we're very uncomfortable with as a society.

You know how poor she was until relatively late in life, how impossibly frugal she was, how she'd never graduated from high school; I loved how she loved art, that she valued something beyond price, as you'd put it, and I really admired her taste--how a canvas at a yard sale in Midwood in like 1952 would catch her eye and over time we'd all realize that she'd found a really great little painting, something that deepened as you spent time with it. Some of my fondest early memories are of going with her to the Met; she particularly loved the anscient sculpture, "It soothes me," she used to say; the marble soothed her. As you know, she worked for various artists--helped get supplies, kept their books--and would get paid in paintings.

It was kind of like that, recovering the memory of what my father had done. The knowledge was always there, I carried it in my body, but I didn't know what I knew, although I knew I knew something and that I dreaded knowing it fully, dreaded it as if only coming into the knowledge, into the memory, would make the event that I was repressing real. And I think Sima was the first person to intuit the contours of this unknown knowledge that I carried; she helped me see that what was missing had a shape, was a piece of the puzzle of my personality, and she made the edges visible--how what I wouldn't let myself know jutted out into other domains of my experience. And once its edges came into view, I could--in fact I could not not--confront the knowledge I'd both always and never had.<br>
You can't really remember what Sima was like back then, when you were four or five, when she went from being my best friend to also being my therapist, although we said we were "consulting," a blurring of boundaries that was, needless to say, problematic; we should have known better--we did know.

Normally, like a good neurotic, I'd double-check the tickets on my computer several times in the weeks before the flights, just to reconfirm the times, that our seats were together, but this subtle dread, this knowledge that wasn't knowledge, prevented me from searching my email for the tickets, so that it wasn't until the night before the trip, when Dad suggested I check in, print the boarding passes, that I discovered--that I could no longer avoid discovering--that I'd never bought them. I can't believe this, I kept exlaiming, as I searched my Gmail, but in fact I had known it on some level all along. But that's not exactly it, or not only it: I think I'd felt that as long as I avoided looking for the tickets, they would be there; it was only if I searched the archive that they'd disappear, as if the past were up until that point indeterminate, that I might outrun it.

From This Movie Changed Me: Groundhog Day<br>
Naomi Alderman (author): I had a lot of thoughts at that time in my teenage years about, "Well, what is the fucking point?" And it was an incredibly live issue for me at that point in my life of saying, "What makes this life, shit, that we are doing right now, worth doing?" In the movie, Phil Connars encounters this question in this incredibly boiled down concentrated form. There he is, he's stuck in a town, he can't change anything, everyday he wakes up and the same song is playing "I Got You Babe." Who has he got every morning? Only himself. That's what he's got. That's the person you have in your life. And so he does what we all do in life: he goes through a process of--first off, he's confused and disorientated and weirded out. Then he decides to try out pleasure: he's gonna eat a lot of food, he's gonna have sex with a girl he can pick up pretty easily by just claiming to have been in the same high school as her. He steals things. He has fun. He watches Jeapordy and gets to know all the answers. He sort of exhaustes the pleasure possibilities of the small town. That's the first stage of spiritual evolution--when he realizes that this is not really doing it. So then there's the girl Rita, the producer Rita, he likes her. He wants to have sex with her. He tries all the tricks he can think of... what he's trying is to try and be like her ideal Tinder match. He's trying to say, "hey, you like water skiing, I like water skiing. You like rocky-road ice cream, I like rocky-road ice cream. We're the same. We're the same." And he can't get her that way. She is a little bit smarter and maybe a little more spiritually evolved than some other people that he's been around. And he finds that there is someone there that he would like to have and that he can't get. Then he becomes extremely depressed. And then he tries to kill himself repeatedly and he realizes he can't kill himself. Why does he become depressed? On one level, I would argue that what depresses him and the thing that attracted him to Rita is that he realizes there is something that she possesses that is of yet unattainable by him. It's not so much about "I can't have sex with this person I want to have sex with" because he apprently could have sex at any point with anyone in this town, but there is something he's seen in her and he knows how far away he is from it. That she has a certain way of being in life and experiencing her life that he has yet to understand but he knows instinctively is important. So he has a period of depression and he tries to kill himself and then he gets to a point where he just has a day when he just wants her to understand who he is. And just tells her: this is what I'm going through, I'm going to prove to you this is what's happening and he experiences her, I think, for the first time as a real human being, not someone he wants to shag or wants to own, but here's a real human that I can connect with briefly. And then, everything is quite different for him. And I think it's beautiful: the movie never tells you this, the movie invites you first of all to go on the journey with him and see if that journey feels convincing and then to ask yourself: what it is that has changed for him at the end? I would argue that what has changed for him is: he's been worn away by being in the presence of other humans so intensely that he is no longer able to perceive them as mindless plebs around him. And he starts, almost without meaning to, to experience the people around him as genuine and real. And he begins to perceive suffering around him. It's extremely Buddhist and I think Harold Ramis was a Buddhist and one of the interpretations of this movie is that it's about the cycle of lives, many lives and that you can reach enlightenment through the cycle of many lives. And one can start experiencing compassion for other human beings around you. There's a part that really makes me cry every time where he's trying to save the life of the old man who he starts out by acknowledging him in the first few days by patting his pocket as if he's looking for a pound for some money to give him and then doesn't give him any money. But then he really tries to save him and he can't save him and the guy, it's his day to die. And I feel it breaks something in him, it breaks something in me, watching these scenes again, every time I cry at this point.<br>
Host: Roger Ebert, when he reviewed this movie for the second time in 2005, years later... he says these beautiful words around Phil. He says: "Phil undergoes his transformation but never loses his edge. He becomes a better Phil, not a different Phil. The movie doesn't get all soppy at the end. There's a dark period when he tries to kill himself, a reckless period when he crashes his car because he knows it doesn't matter, the times of despair. We see that life is like that. Tomorrow will come and whether or not it is always February 2, all we can do about it is be the best person we know how to be. The good news is that we can learn to be better people. There's a moment when Phil tells Rita, 'That when you stand in the snow, you look like an angel.' The point is not that he has come to love Rita, it is that he has learned to see the angel."<br>
Naomi: And he continues to be a little selfish, which I love.<br>
Host: This is a realistic portrayal of a man, of a human being.<br>
...Naomi: Watching it again, I was particularly struck by the way that he isn't a monster at the start and he's not an angel at the end. It's a realistic softening of someone who kind of always knew. It's about a mid-life crisis. It's about the moment when you realize that you've somehow come away from the things that you knew instinctively when you were a child about the appreciation of the tiniest moments in life and the fact that all other human beings around you are real and that you can have compassion for their suffering. About what it means to be a good person, about what it means to try to help, about what it means to always be growing--it's about a man who reaches a point maybe, lets say, at the point where he reaches Rita at the start, sort of playing around with the blue screen, that he has been using in his very own artful way and then he sees her playing with it. And in some way, this sums up what he's lost: is a sense for the wonder of the tinest things around him. And the movie never answers how this happened to him, which is wonderful. One thing you could suggest is that in that moment, he realizes he's gonna have to fix something, and this thing that happened to him is something that he needed, he wanted it, he called to it, he asked for it. Maybe.<br> So I saw this when I was 18. I must have watched it at least once a year since then. So that's at least 25 times, and perhaps more. I feel like there were times when I was watching it more than once a year because I felt like it had some answers for me about what constituted a good life... I feel like maybe now, I'm starting to find the edges of it. If I believe this, then what is really worth doing with my life? What is worth doing is stuff that somehow works on myself, my inner self, whether that's my psychotherapy or learning new skills or reading great books or improving my sensitivity towards the world, or that it's trying to help. And even though I'm a fiction writer, I think a lot of my work has been oriented towards some way of trying to help. I understand that many people, I think, would think that fiction that's got "a message" is not as good as fiction that is sort of very intensely truthful about the human experience, but man, do you know what helped me? It was Groundhog Day.<br> One thing about this movie that I took from it that was unhelpful is that it's a movie that posits that when you make yourself into the best version of yourself you could possibly be, then your perfect person will turn up and your person will notice you and appreciate that in you. And I'm here to tell you that that does not happen. It's a blatent lie. It's great to be a better version of yourself but that process, and that process is two ways of saying the same thing which is that the process of being in relationship with another human is a different set of skills and how about if Rita hadn't pursued Phil? How about if he had got to that point and been that person and then it had ended and then he had to convince her that he was the one for her? Or that he would just have to move on. This is not a criticism of the movie. It's just to say that no single movie can be a blueprint for your whole life. But this one is pretty close. I'd say this will get you through, at least 35... It has gotten me a really long way, it really has. Those questions about how you identify your perfect person, how you become a person who is good to be in a relationship with, those are not the questions that are addressed. On the subject of how to be a good human, yea, there's nothing more to be said, actually.<br>
Host: And how to see the beauty in the mundane and the everyday.<br>
Naomi: It's a thing that I do sometimes. It sounds weird but it's sort of a spiritual practice. Every now and then when I feel like I've been through some hard times or I've become a little too blasse about my life, I spend a month every single day going to a place I haven't been to before. And you can do this while traveling obviously. But it's more effective if you do this very close to where you live. Things that are within half an hour where you live. In other words, you could have always gone there but you never bothered to get off your beaten track. You've never ever gone to have a look at that tiny weird art gallery that you pass by everyday on your walk to work. You've never gone to sit at that park. You've never gone to be in that church. You've never tried the baguette from that cafe. Sometimes I do this everyday for a month just to literally, it could be 5 minutes, pop in, but suddenly I have the sense of the incredible richness around me, of things that I've seen but not really noticed. At some point in that month, I will receive the benediction: at some moment, I will suddenly become aware of the incredible beauty and richness of everything around me. So I'll look at a brick wall and suddenly be completly struck by the difference and the there-ness, the this-ness of every single brick in that wall, and how much has gone into just even creating that single wall, and look, someone's gone and put windows in there, and look the plants, and a little bee that just buzzed past me. When you look at the world that way, when you look at the world with the Phil Connar's eyes, when you go right through the sense of (on we?), through the despair, right through to the other side, and all you can see is how amazing it is to be allowed to be alive right now.

If I said, Klaus, you're claiming the problem is they have it too easy, but you're also saying having it too easy is too hard; you're saying that it's always been this way, but that it's also the sign of a specific imperial decline, this vacuum at the heart of privilege, then Klaus would respond by delivering his signature quotation from Niels Bohr, the quotation he always quoted when he seemed to contradict himself, a saying his conversation was inexorably working toward, one he loved so much he'd stop and stand still, smiling, to deliver it: "The opposite of a truth," Klaus quoted, "is a falsehood; but the opposite of a profound truth"--pause for emphasis, sound of sprinklers, insects, push mowers, felt absence of city noise, Kenny Rogers from a passing car--"may be another profound truth." It either is or is not August (Klaus removes his anachronistic glasses, round lenses, wipes his face, replaces them, resumes walking); if I assert it's August when it isn't--simply false; but if I say that life is pain, that is true, profoundly so; so, too, that life is joy; the more profound the statement, the more reversible; the deep truths are sedimented in syntax, the terms can be reversed, just as there is no principle of noncontradiction, no law of excluded middle, governing the unconscious. Then, briefly serious, Klaus would touch my shoulder: A quote like that can save your life.

From This Movie Changed Me: Groundhog Day<br>
Host: For Naomi, the movie is a reminder that we have to take every single day, no matter how mundane, and stop and look around, and observe, and appreciatiate everything around us, and the people that come in and out of our lives.<br>
Naomi Alderman: What is that movie about? Here, to me, is the critical line in the movie. Early on when Phil Connars also known as the weather man, Bill Murray, is working out what has happened to him. He is sitting at a bar with two town drunks, essentially. And he says to them: "Well what would you do if everyday was the same and you were stuck in one place and nothing that you did mattered?" And one of them says: "Well, that about sums it up for me." And this is the point. This is the point is that this, in essence, is all of our lives.<br>
Host: We probably did the same things we did yesterday.<br>
Naomi: Exactly! And the human experience is an experience of repetition. We wake up in the morning, our bodies need food, our bodies need washing, our bodies need exercise, we have to clean our teeth. We need to do something to make money, we have people we have to connect to. The same thing again and again and again and again. And does what we do matter? This is the question of the movie. So Phil Connars is a man who goes through the experience of human life in a condensed and accelerated form where he has to confront, he can't be distracted by the sort of petty novelty that a lot of us distract ourselves with in our lives. He has to face the essential repetitive trapness of human existence.

Pauline: We don't just deny death in our culture. I think we deny ambiguous loss that comes with things like immigration and homesickness comes along with that. And we really want people to get over it. And they don't. And it's paradoxical: the more you want people to get over it, the longer it will take for them and why not remember your former country, your former island, your former culture while you are learning to fit into the new one? In other words, having two cultures is what it ends up being. And you have one foot in the old and one foot in the new. And one can live that way. That may be the most honest way to do it.

What I knew as much by instinct as by training was that when a boy like Jacob shows up in your cramped but light-filled [psychiatric] office, you should not under any circumstances ask him to account for his behavior (or the eraser burns all over his forearms, althought para-suicidal rituals were much more common among girls); Jacob would be the last person capable of such an account; if he had the language he wouldn't express himself with symptoms.<br>
...Here is a flyer about the new film production major at the University of Kansas, something to keep an eye on in the future. However unconventional, a therapeutic alliance had been formed.<br>
...Now Jacob would at least respond--he was the first kid to call me Dr.J--and if I could get the rhythm of quiet right, I could draw him out a little. I wasn't interested in extracting latent content, making manifest some deeper truth motivating Jacob's speech; my goal was to make the kid feel heard. I didn't mind the cliche; in fact, I admired the phrase, its rightness of fit, a mixture of the somatic and semantic; maybe it explained the desire for heavy metal that registered as touch as much as sound. How much easier it would be if when you played them slowly in reverse the lyrcis really did, as some hysterical parents feared, reveal satanic messages; if there were a backmasked secret order, however dark, instead of rage at emptiness.

KAY
As you said, my name is Katharine
Graham and I am the owner and
publisher of the Washington Post.
I've been in the newspaper business
almost my whole life. My father
purchased the paper when I was
sixteen and - well - all I ever
wanted to do was work at it. It...
took me a little longer than I
thought it would, but, well,
sometimes things happen as they
should, I think.
As I said, I've been in this
business nearly my whole life and
never, never, have I seen a story
that displays such a wanton
disregard for the public interest.
To have hidden these decisions made
without the people's knowledge that
resulted in decades of torture,
murder, and oppression.
My father, when he stepped down,
issued a press release. He said,
“The citizens of a free country
have to depend on a free press for
the information necessary to the
intelligent discharge of their
duties of citizenship. That is why
the Constitution gives newspapers
express protection from Government
interference.” It... it might have
taken me a little while longer than
my father would've hoped to truly
understand these words but... I
believe them to be true. It is my
responsibility to stand behind my
staff and the truth of their
convictions to tell this story. It
is our duty.
This paper has been in my life
longer than most of my staff has
been alive. And the legacy it
carries is not just my name, but my
father's name. My husband's name.
And my decision to publish these
papers is one that could put into
jeopardy the lot of it.
However, if the decision is made by
the courts to side with the
government, and the Washington Post
ceases to exist, I can think of no
stronger mark to leave than by
taking a stand for what is right.
And there will have been no greater
honor in my life than to be beside
the men and women of the Post while
we attempt to do just that.
Thank you.

From Ben Lerner<br>
I always assume that you don't write the poem you want to write. You don't make the book you want to make. On the one hand, that can be kind of depressing, but on the other hand, that's actually quite free because it means you discover something in the act of composition that you didn't know in advance. Generally, I think of art as really about trying to actualize impossible desires with form and you always fail to make the virtual actual. You always fail to transform the world through your poem or whatever but the failure itself can be beautiful or pleasurable and it can kind of exercise imaginative faculties that aren't exercised when you're just making things you know how to make.
	</p>

	<p id="1286">
From Ben Lerner<br>
That's the public part of publication in a way. No one's going to make a million dollars with a poetry book but you can kind of make a life. It can help you make a life.
	</p>

	<p id="1285">
From Ben Lerner<br>
It was clear that all I was doing was writing into the sequence and the sequence wasn't done with me... And then there's a certain point where I felt there were just no more of them[poems] in me. I was really relieved to find that I had exhausted the tendency and now I was going to do something else or nothing for a while. Publication, even on a really small poetry scale, also changes your relationship to your own work. It helps you feel finished, like now I'm not going back into that work, and in it, it's the final way of estranging it from you. It no longer seems like it's just something in your head, it feels like it's an object in the object world.
	</p>


	<p id="1284">
From Ben Lerner<br>
I had an intuition as a poet that there was an intimate relationship between the detachment of language from reality and the use of language as a kind of instrument of violence. If you're referring to a bomb as a daisy cutter, it's easier to distance yourself from the embodied reality of the consequence of a policy.<br>
Line from a poem: Tears appreciate in this economy of pleasure.

	<p id="1283">
From Ben Lerner<br>
My friend and I were always threatening to quit. We always claimed we weren't getting anything done. Now, when I look back, we had a real and kind of intense practice. We were more collaborative than competitive. I would work on a poem and I would take it to his room, five yards away, and we'd have a conversatino about it. Really, the reason we didn't know if we were doing any work is because we never really had a clear separation between work and leisure. We were always trying to desperately be equal to these first books. But the thing was that the first poems came effortlessly and then it took me four years of self-lacerating torture to write the rest of them.
	</p>

	<p id="1282">
From Ben Lerner on his poetry book/collection: The Lichtenberg Figures<br>
What happened with the Lichtenberg Figures is that there was this initial kind of like burst where it was just really easy to write these poems. Jack Spicer talks about the poet taking dictation. It was like somebody else is speaking through you and you're just writing it down... With the first book, you don't really know if you can do it. You have a kind of constant anxiety about whether or not you have something to contribute to the conversation and that anxiety, it can ruin your life but it's also really generative, like it's a kind of discipline.

Sam: Simple question, Lorr. Cake or pie? What team do I ride for?<br>

Sam: I'm a pie person, Lorraine. Just like you. Your favorite is strawberry. The trashy kind with condensed milk in the middle. You love it because your grandma Violet used to make it for you, and you'd hide it from your mother because she didn't appreciate you having sweets. Because until you developed an eating disorder in ninth grade, you were a little on the husky side. your words. You know why I know this? It's because I know everything about you. Not only do I know everything about you, but I remember everything about you. My folder on you is so fat and complete and bursting with nonsensical shit because I couldn't help myself. Your hands? Bullshit. Your feet, your knobby, misshapen feet are the real threat, and that's a fact. You know, I thought you didn't know me because I was insecure or broken or poor, and then I thought about it. It's because you never asked. Ever. I want to be with someone I can talk to. I want to be with someone who automatically has a fat folder on me. Someone who feels lucky when I tell them the most unflattering, scary stuff. I don't think I love you anymore, and I got to be honest, I don't believe that you love me.<br>
Lorraine: I'm sorry you feel that way.<br>
Sam: That's not an apology. You know that, right?<br>

Penny read her notes from J.A.'s class about this Russian dude Viktor Shklovsky's Theory of Prose. It was about how to write, and his theory was that in art you had to shape experiences so that what you wrote was exciting--to the point where the mundane seemed magical and extraordinary. You had to make people feel something even if you were staring at a rock. "Make the stone stony!" he insisted.<br>

Sam: What do you love about your writing class?<br>
Penny: Nothing. I hate it. Also I love it.<br>
Sam: Obvs. Say more.<br>
Penny: OK. It's as close as I've ever gotten to feeling like a writer, a real one. You sit there and you have to do it. Everyone is capable of putting words down. Or telling a story. But not everyone will actually do it. This class is about the doing and getting better feels professional, not like a normal college class where you learn things you'll never apply.<br>
Sam didn't say anything. No thought bubble, no interruption, no nothing, Penny went on.<br>
Penny: You know how you can make a sound on a piano? Anyone with fingers can do it. Intuitive. You hit keys, they make noise. Writing and reading, then rewriting and then editing is how you make a melody. It's the same for everyone. It's not about raw talent or having such a big ego that you think what you have to say is so important. Or who your parents are and what they do. It's the practice of it, doing it until you're good. Does that make sense?<br>
Sam: Totally. And I get it. What do you hate about it?<br>
Penny started writing back. And then stopped. She took another stab at it.<br>
Penny: It's so haaaaaaaaaard. It hurts my feelings it's so hard. And it's scary.<br>
Sam: ahahah. Well Yeah. Guess that's what makes it worth doing? It's as scary as you can get. Writers die trying. Do you call yourself a writer?<br>
Penny: Ew no.<br>
Sam: Why ew?<br>
Penny: I feel like a fraud.<br>
Sam: Yeah imposter syndrome.<br>
Penny: ... I just... (she tried again.) I haven't ever seen a writer, a big deal writer who looks like me and sometimes when I write, I imagine the hero as white, like automatically. How fucked is that.<br>
...Sam: So you want to be a writer and i want to make movies. Feels corny to say out loud. But that's OK. It's important to at least admit it to yourself and to a few trusted people.<br>
Penny: Your emergency contact for example.<br>
Sam: Lol exactly. Then you make it real.<br>

From Emergency Contact by Mary H.K. Choi<br>
J.A. (English professor): Look, I hate writing. And I'm the type of writer who hates it every single time. But make no mistake: It's something that you get to do. Especially fiction. I think of it this way. If there was an apocalypse--zombies, the sun explodes, whatever--fiction writing as a job would be the thousandth priority behind SoulCycle instructors. It's a privilege, and part of acknowledging that privilege is doing it honorably. Create diverse characters because you can. Especially ones that aren't easy to write. A character that scares you is worth exploring. Yet if you breathe life into a character and it comes to you too easily--say you're writing from the viewpoint of a black man in America and you're not one? Think hard about where your inspiration is coming from. Are you writing stereotypes? Tropes? Are you fetishizing the otherness? Whose ideas are you spreading? Really consider how you transmit certain optics over others. Think about how much power that is. It's about finding the truth in fiction. Which sounds contradictory. But the story will let you know if you're close.<br>
Penny's brain buzzed. J.A. had called writers powerful, which meant Penny was powerful.<br>
It took Penny a moment to realize her mouth was hanging open a little. If Maus was galvanizing moment number one in Penny's plans to become a writer, the heart-hammering feeling in J.A.'s class was two. Maybe two and three. She'd been invited to a secret society. It reorganized her thoughts with such intensity that she had the sudden urge to pee.<br>
Penny had been writing all the time, for years now. She'd never stopped even if she showed no one. Stories, lists of ideas, and strange chunks of amusing dialogue that came to her while she ignored whatever else was going on in her actual life. She knew she was decent. Only she wanted more. Penny wanted to get really good. And she wanted for J.A. Hanson to recognize exactly how good.

Penny knew Maus(the comic book) was going to be formative. Not that she was going to become a career criminal, more that she felt destined to make something that made someone else feel how she did when she read it.<br>
...Yet it wasn't until she read Maus and lived it through the eyes of a father and son mouse, that she saw past the cold facts. That night Penny read Maus twice and cried. She knew then that she had to become a writer.

"Why film?" Penny squeaked. On some level she knew whatever you picked in college didn't matter in the real world. People rarely pursued a career in accordance with their major, though it was a decent Rorschach test for self-perception. It said everything about how you saw yourself.<br>
"I wanted to be a documentary filmmaker," he said. Penny wondered about the past tense. "There are so many unbelievable stories going on in the world, just quietly happening around you. There's this Hitchcock quote about how in regular movies the director is God and how in documentaries God in the director. I always loved that."

                          PERLMAN
                You two had a nice friendship.<br>

                           ELIO
                    (somewhat evasive)
                Yes.<br>

      Another pause, and another drag on his cigarette.<br>

                          PERLMAN
                You're too smart not to know how
                rare, how special, what you two had
                was.<br>

                          ELIO
                Oliver was Oliver.<br>

                          PERLMAN
                “Parce-que c'etait lui, parce-que
                c'etait moi.” (Because he was he,
                because I was I)<br>

                     ELIO
              (trying to avoid talking
               about Oliver with his
               father)
          Oliver may be very intelligent -<br>

                     PERLMAN
              (interrupting his son)
          Intelligent? He was more than
          intelligent. What you two had had
          everything and nothing to do with
          intelligence. He was good, and you
          were both lucky to have found each
          other, because you too are good.<br>

                    ELIO
          I think he was better than me.<br>

                    PERLMAN
          I'm sure he'd say the same thing
          about you, which flatters the two
          of you.<br>

In tapping his cigarette and leaning toward the ashtray, he
reaches out and touches Elio's hand. PERLMAN alters his tone
of voice (his tone says: We don't have to speak about it, but
let's not pretend we don't know what I'm saying).<br>

                    PERLMAN (CONT'D)
          When you least expect it, Nature
          has cunning ways of finding our
          weakest spot. Just remember: I am
          here. Right now you may not want to
          feel anything. Perhaps you never
          wished to feel anything. And
          perhaps it's not to me that you'll
          want to speak about these things.
          But feel something you obviously
          did.<br>

ELIO looks at his father, then drops his eyes to the floor.<br>

                    PERLMAN (CONT'D)
          Look - you had a beautiful
          friendship. Maybe more than a
          friendship. And I envy you. In my
          place, most parents would hope the
          whole thing goes away, to pray that
          their sons land on their feet. But
          I am not such a parent. In your
          place, if there is pain, nurse it.
          And if there is a flame, don't
          snuff it out. Don't be brutal with
          it.
          We rip out so much of ourselves to
          be cured of things faster, that we
          go bankrupt by the age of thirty
          and have less to offer each time we
          start with someone new. But to make
          yourself feel nothing so as not to
          feel anything - what a waste!<br>

ELIO is dumbstruck as he tries to take all this in.<br>

                    PERLMAN (CONT'D)
          Have I spoken out of turn?<br>

ELIO shakes his head.<br>

                    PERLMAN (CONT'D)
          Then let me say one more thing. It
          will clear the air. I may have come
          close, but I never had what you two
          had. Something always held me back
          or stood in the way. How you live
          your life is your business.
          Remember, our hearts and our bodies
          are given to us only once. And
          before you know it, your heart is
          worn out, and, as for your body,
          there comes a point when no one
          looks at it, much less wants to
          come near it. Right now there's
          sorrow. Pain. Don't kill it and
          with it the joy you've felt.<br>

PERLMAN takes a breath.<br>

                    PERLMAN (CONT'D)
          We may never speak about this
          again. But I hope you'll never hold
          it against me that we did. I will
          have been a terrible father if, one
          day, you'd want to speak to me and
          felt that the door was shut, or not
          sufficiently open.<br>

                    ELIO
          Does mother know?<br>

                    PERLMAN
          I don't think she does.<br>

But the way he says this means “Even if she did, I am sure
her feelings would be no different than mine.”

               Not that you mean to

                 This is in German, but I'll
                 translate:
                 “...A handsome young knight is
                 madly in love with a princess. She
                 too is in love with him...

               ...though she seems not to be
               entirely aware of it.
               Despite the friendship...
               that blossoms
               between them, or perhaps because of
               that very friendship, the young
               knight finds himself so humbled and
               speechless that he is totally
               unable to bring up the subject of
               his love. One day he asks the
               princess point-blank: ‘Is it better
               to speak or die'.<br>

     The lights suddenly all go out in the house; the music from a
     long-playing record dies to a stop. There is a shout in the
     kitchen, MAFALDA.<br>

From Mary H.K. Choi<br>
There's like a Warren Buffer quote about prioritizing. You make two lists. It's 25 things that you want to do with your life before you die. You take the 5 most important, put them on one list. The rest of the 20 go on another list. And as the story goes, you'd think like naturally, that you would focus on these five but then dabble in these other twenty when you have time. But it's not. It's that to do 5, you must ignore the twenty, no matter how good you are at it, no matter how seductive it is, no matter how much money it will make you. Because if you are to do the five before you die that's what it's going to take.

For the first time, Grace half smiles. She tells Martina she is absolutely, one hundred percent sure. She is not going back this time [to her abusive husband].<br>
...[Martina] asks about the police who came when Grace called, the ones who first took the order. "Were they nice to you?" Martina asks her.<br>
"Oh," Grace says, "they were very nice."<br>
"Good," Martina says. She asks every client this same question. Were the police nice? Did they do their job? Were they polite? No one requires her to ask this question, she just does. The Cleveland police, she is well aware, have long had a reputation for corruption, for racial profiling. The Tamir Rice killing thrust the force into the national spotlight more than any other event in recent history. "The hardest thing to do is call the police on someone," she tells me later. "Everyone has a bad day, but it's important to me to know how people view the police. It should be important to the police to know how people feel."<br>
"How do you feel now?" Martina asks Grace.<br>
"I feel everything," Grace tells her. "Happy, sad, scared."<br>
When Byron goes before the judge, he will be put on a GPS bracelet. And he'll face multiple charges in court that include felonious assault, endangering children, kidnapping, and intimidation, among others.<br>
Later, over pizza, Martina takes a call from Grace. Byron has stolen her credit card and run up a bunch of charges. Martina goes through the steps of what Grace should do: call the credit card company, get a new card, cancel the old one, keep a record of it all. Martina says she'll add it to her report. It's the kind of thing that is maybe beyond the scope of her job, but she takes these calls anyway. "When I have to handle your case, there's a big problem," she says, as she hangs up with Grace. "But I try to be the detective that I wanted my sister to have."<br>
More than a year passes, and I catch up with Martina on the phone late one winter afternoon. Grace held out for a long time, months, much longer than Martina thought she would. But then, just as Martina had predicted, Grace recanted. Instead of jail time, Byron got probation. And Grace? The last Martina heard she'd taken Byron back. Before we hang up, Martina makes one last prediction: "I'm sure I'll hear from her again."

If someone I'd known for thirty-eight years [her mom] could keep her abuse from me, what did it say about how we deal with abuse in our midst today, the shame and stigma it still carries? When she finally died, my father and i stood in the kitchen sobbing. It was the second time I'd witnessed this specific scene, my father crying over a wife lost too young to cancer, but this time I was an adult and I understood so much more--of what she'd gone through, of what he was going through. He apologized to me that day and for the next weeks every time he broke down for "not being stronger." Here was a man who'd just lost his second wife to cancer and yet he didn't feel he had a right to public tears. Why? I told him his tears made him stronger, in my eyes, as a man, as a husband, as a father, that he didn't fear his full range of human emotion. It's a lesson I wish I could impart to all men.<br>
It is for these reasons, these two moments, one with my stepmother and one with my father, that I dedicate this book to her. I am grateful I was able to tell her that I was doing so before she died.

Dunne never got emotional in these trainings. She was meticulous and impassive, a perfect picture of the lawyer she had almost once become.<br>
...I used to get a sandwich for lunch and park on Green Street at Dorothy's house and sit eating it in my rental car. I don't know what I was doing, really. There was no evidence of her life or her death there now, but the street was quiet, idyllic. Sometimes I was sure I could smell the sea...It was a time when--between interviews and research--I could be reflective. Maybe Dorothy had become a shadow body in my life, too. So often when reporters write about issues, we are covering stories of the living, speaking to change makers, policy makers, who are alive and well. But in domestic violence, I suspect for many of us it is often the dead with whom we really commune.<br>
I asked Dunne, sitting in her office, what she would say to Dorothy today, if she returned from the dead and walked right back into the office.<br>
..."No one's ever asked me that before," she said.<br>
I sat without speaking.<br>
Dunne came back to her desk, wiped at her eyes. Then she looked at me and whispered, "I would tell her I'm sorry."

As I wait for my late-night Lyft driver, it strikes me that Naomi[domestic violence telephone response line worker] isn't just a symbol of progress because of where she'd come from; she herself was a survivor, yes, but a survivor who'd found a way to disrupt the cycle in her own small way. A former hurt person helping to heal people. There is a place in the system for her now, just as there is for Jimmy. And maybe someday even for Donte. Like there was for Victoria, the woman I'd seen years earlier in the San Bruno jail whose father had once planned to kill her in a Denny's restaurant. Nearly everyone I'd ever me in the world of domestic violence had stories of abuse, as victims or perpetrators or witnesses. hamish Sinclair and David Adams had abusive fathers. Suzanne Dubus was raped one winter night by two men. Jacquelyn Campbell had her former student, Annie; Martina Latessa had her sister, Brandi. Jimmy and Donte had the men they'd once been. Behind every one of them was this shadow of another body, a terrible story. But all of them were also the disruptors now, changing the future narrative.

Andy[activist]: In some ways, men have been the biggest beneficiaries of the women's movement. Look at all the men who have a very different relationship [today] with their children. They go to school events; they talk to their kids. In my neighborhood, the guys are always walking their kids to daycare, to school. Look at how involved young fathers are. It's not perfect, and women still bear the burden in many ways, but they have experienced a change.<br>

It is insidious, infecting so many other challenges we as a society face, in education and healthcare, in poverty and addiction, in mental health and mass shootings and homelessness and unemployment. Given the sheer span of issues that domestic violence intersects with, whatever solutions we imagine for the future must take this breadth into account. We cannot address homelessness without addressing the fact that domestic violence accounts for so many homeless families. We cannot successfully adress educational disparity or poverty without addressing how much domestic violence can be a root cause of such problems. I think of the relatively minuscule funding we give to VAWA relative to other governmental expenditures, and remember Rosenthal's solution: to "invest everywhere." Her point was not about investing endless resources so much as acknowledging through our solutions the complicated ways that domestic violence launches so many of these other problems.<br>
Rosenthal says the #MeToo movement is a sign of progress. It didn't just erupt out of nowhere, she tells me. This moment in our lives, in fact, reminds her of the time around the OJ trial, when suddenly conversations about domestic violence began to happen on a national scale. From those conversations came changes--substantive, groundbreaking, important changes, many of which show up in this book. "#MeToo came from years of laying the groundwork. Lots of people having these discussions and suddenly conditions were right for it to happen," she says.<br>
David Adams, too, sees unique opportunities in this moment. "It's discouraging," he told me recently of our present time, "but I do think it's [energized] young people... And more and more people--especially women and minorities--are getting mobilized,"<br>
Throughout my reporting, it struck me how often I came upon such seemingly small changes that wound up making the difference between life and death, between a good decision and a bad one. A bag of diapers and grocery money, a laminated order of protection rather than paper, an afternoon court time rather than early morning, visiting a victim's house rather than waiting for a visit, taking a literal step back from an argument rather than a step forward. If I had to whittle down the changing world of domestic violence to just one idea that made all the difference, it would be communication. Across bureaucracies, certainly, but also political ideologies and programs, people and systems and disciplines. So many of the changes I saw when I traveled around the country came down to this one single act. The High Risk Teams, family justice centers, youth programs and batterer intervention and court initiatives, fatality review teams and police protocols and any number of other programs all shared this one absolutely free resource: they talked to one another.

"It's okay to still love [your husband, even though he beats you]." Nesbitt says, reaching her hand toward Grace's leg. "But we're involved now, and we're going to get you and your children the help you need." She tells a story then that might be true, might be apocryphal. This one detective, Nesbitt says, used to be on their squad, and he was lactose intolerant. Wouldn't you know it, his favorite food was ice cream. He loved ice cream. But every time he ate it, it made him sick. Luck of the draw. What were the chances? Didn't mean he still didn't want to eat it. Just that he knew if he ate it, he was going to get sick. Grace gets it.<br>
"This is going to be the hardest thing you ever do. It's also the most courageous," Martina says... Martina brings up the kids, the abuse they've witnessed, and how Grace has a responsibility to them. "The environment we put our children in will have a profound effect on who they are when they grow up," Martina says. "So these little boys, they may start to do this to others."<br>
Grace wipes at her eyes. "I know, I know."<br>
But Martina doesn't let her off the hook that easily. "You doing this is going to let them know it's not allowed, okay?"<br>
Grace nods.<br>
Later, I will ask Martina if she thinks Grace will really go through with leaving Byron, and she nods. She thinks she can sometimes tell when victims are ready; when they go from being victims to being survivors. Domestic violence literature talks about that average of seven tries before a victim actually leaves. But it's not entirely accurate, because victims vacate emotionally first, sometimes years before they are actually physcially able to leave. And for Grace, it seemed clear that whatever fear she was feeling about Byron, and whatever sadness may have set in about the breakup, the thought of leaving her children to be raised without her was now driving her decisions. Byron had tipped the scales.

...I imagine [Grace] thinking of all the times she's returned, all the decisions she's probably blaming herself for, all the times she maybe didn't call the police [on her husband for beating her]. I can picture her thinking about her kids' faces, imagining maybe the angry face of Byron[Grace's husband], wondering how she ever got to this place. No victim of domestic violence--man or woman, adult or child--ever imagines that they're the type of person who would wind up in such a situation. Whatever we envision when we envision a victim, there is one universal truth to each and every one of those images: none of us ever picture ourselves.<br>
What we might conjure, if anything at all, is a punch. Someone we're dating, one punch, and we'd be gone. But that's not how it happens. It evolves over time. A partner who might not like your makeup. Or a suggestive outfit. Maybe he'll say it's for your own protection. Then a few months later, maybe he yells a little louder than you've heard before. Maybe he throws something, a fork, a chair, a plate. (It's worth noting that should that plate bounce off the wall and break into shards, and should a shard cut you in the face, the Supreme Court considers it "intentional" abuse.) Then, in between weeks and months of some good times, and some not-so-good times, you might hear how he knows men look at you, he sees other men looking at you. You might even feel complimented by this. But then maybe he follows it up with a request that you stay home with him a little more. Maybe this, too, is for your "protection." And that one friend you have, the loud one? He knows she doesn't like him. And before you even realize it's happening that friend's falling away from your life. Then, a couple of years in, he loses his job, comes home in a mood, pushes you into a wall. And you know that's not him, not really. You've been with him awhile now. Anyone would feel bad, losing a job. And he apologized, right? Seemed truly remorseful. And then the next month it's a slap, a backhanded shove, another thrown plate. But neither the control nor the abuse tend to come at once, lit up like a punch. They leak out slowly over time like radon.

[Officer Martina] said her father wore the pants in the family, but her mother picked out the ones he was going to wear.<br>
..."Those Koziol sisters toughed me up," [Martina] says. She coached six- and seven-year-olds, the peewee leagues, and ran the summer T-ball program. Then later, she coached young girls and teenagers. Softball, volleyball, wherever she was needed. She met kids who were abused, kids whose parents were drug addicts, kids in foster care. Kids caught in a relentless system of poverty and violence. She heard street lingo for the first time, saw neighborhood drug dealers just hanging around, drumming up business. "Working with [the Koziols] prepared me for what I would face in the police," she says. "Holy shit. Without that toughness they gave me I would have never, ever, ever made it."<br>
...The lessons she learned playing organized sports--not pickup games, or backyard sports, but on formal teams--became essential in her police work.<br>
"In order to play sports, you have to be coached. You have to learn to take someone's advice, criticism. Just shut the fuck up and let them teach you," [Martina] says.

To understand how effective [Officer] Martina Latessa is at her job, it might help to think about a small plastic animal she has on her desk. From the front, it has the body of a frog, from the back, a chamelon, and it is so colorful that it's futile to search for clues as to its identifications. It's not like anything found in nature. It looks like one thing from one angle, another thing from another angle, and--when viewed as a whole--is something in a category unto itself. It's disarming, also funny, and a little bit ridiculous.<br>
You don't have to go far to find metaphors in Martina's world.<br>
...Martina is preternaturally suited to her job, perhaps the most effective police officer I've ever seen on a domestic violence case. When I mention this to her, she says, "You lie!" But her blush gives her away. (When she introduces me around the department, she says, "This is Rachel I-hate-the-Cleveland-police Snyder." Later, I will learn that my best defense is calling her a Steelers fan.) It's this chameleon-like quality she has about her--in the space of a few moments, she can communicate the unbelievable danger that Grace is in, joke around with Mark like it's just another day in the life of an adolescent boy and his pet, and kid around with Joey that he better watch himself. Most people, myself included, when presented with an autistic toddler, would likely just ignore the child. Maybe ask if someone can watch him for a moment. Martina brings him right into the action. It's a subtle way of telling Grace, "I see how complicated your life is, and it won't put me off." Later, she'll tell me she knew he had autism the second she walked in the door.<br>
... That [Martina] meets victims in their own homes, or the homes of friends and family, rather than forcing them through a bureaucratic maze of departments and courthouses and crisis centers, is meaningful. That she jokes around, asks about the rest of their lives, spends as many hours as it takes, is meaningful. That she is only one person, a severely limited resource, is also meaningful.

But [Cornerstone apartments] is not a place that seems, at all, like a shelter, where everything is shared, everything is a negotiation with someone else. Families have privacy; most of the sixty or so kids who live here [in this apartment] at any given time don't even know they're in a domestic violence program. The [apartment] units are a kind of visual symbol of hope. That a future without violence can exist for them and for their children.

In the ensuing decades, however, what this has meant is that domestic violence has been lumped in with other family matters, like custody and divorce, rather than being the criminal matter that it is. Imagine a man, a stranger, strangling another man with a phone cord, pushing another man down the stairs, punching another man so hard he breaks an orbital eye socket. Such assaults happen daily with domestic violence, but I have yet to speak with a prosecutor who sees these crimes treated as seriously as when they happen in the context of domestic violence. "It shocked me, the things someone would do to a family member that they wouldn't do on the street, or in a bar fight," a former prosecutor from Ohio named Anne Tamashasky told me. The day William Cotter showed up in court, he paid $500 and bailed out minutes after he'd turned himself in [for assaulting his wife, Dorothy].<br>
Five days later, William arrived at Dorothy's house wearing a tactical vest and armed with pepper spray, handcuffs, ammunition belts, and a sawed-off shotgun. Kaitlyn[Dorothy's and William's daughter] was at a friend's house; Kristin [Dorothy's and William's other daughter] unwittingly opened the front door. As soon as she heard his voice, Dorothy barricaded herself in her bedroom. William pushed past Kristen and broke down the door to Dorothy's bedroom, dragging her out in seconds. Kristin ran upstairs and called a neighbor, who called 911--an arrangement Dunne[domestic violence social worker] had worked out so Kristen didn't have the psychological burden of calling the police on her father. The police arrived within minutes.<br>
I freeze the scene in this crucial moment sometimes: Dorothy, still alive, held hostage by her abusive husband, and the police there--half the force, it seemed--guns drawn and ready. The family was known in the department now both because of Officer Poulin and because of Detective Wile and the day Dorothy went to see him. Wile understood by now that Cotter was dangerous, maybe more dangerous than most, and he shared it around the station to be on the lookout. And this is the moment: William is alive. Dorothy is alive. Dispatch is on the phone. The police are there.<br>
Was this a scene she had ever imagined, sitting there with Detective Wile, telling him how she would die in her own house? She was thirty-two years old, not even halfway through her life. She had the glamorous look of an actress from the 1940s, a more ordinary Hedy Lamarr or Loretta Young.<br>
Did Dorothy have time to remember that fateful day when she was fifteen years old and she met a boy who claimed to fall in love with her at first sight? Did she blame that young version of herself? Did she consider how her culture pushes little girls toward love, tells them love ocnquers all? Did she ever wonder why we don't tell more stories of love's defeat? I don't believe love conquers all. So many things in this world seem more powerful than love. Duty. Rage. Fear. Violence.

And this brings Jimmy to his third story, the one I only heard once and could never verify with anyone from his family. The one that guts him the most. It's not a long story, or an unusual story. But he calls it the most painful day of his life. "Twelve years old," he says. His daughter was sexually molested, by someone they all knew.<br>
"I had to make some serious decisions," [Jimmy] tells them. "Either I go and knock this mother fucker's head off, because I had all the right reasons, you know? Do some time for the next thirty years, but it's not a big deal. I'm a gangbanger anyway. I live comfortably in every facility, any facility. Do I kill this motherfucker or do i not do a thing?"<br>
That's what he thinks his decision was in the moment when he received the news. Kill the guy, or not. But really, he says, he realized that wasn't his decision at all. The decision was actually "Do I make it about me and go kill this motherfucker? Or do i make it about my daughter, and be there for her?" If he kills the guy, he takes himself out of his daughter's life at the moment she needs him the most.<br>
"Shit," one new guy whispers.<br>
"I'm going to make sure, each and every one of you, that your partners are not afraid when you go home," Jimmy says quietly. "I work front line for the victim, and I want to see you better your life, because that's one more safe woman in the world."

With every [Facebook] post, women are dripping with platitudes, inspired by [Jimmy's] story of survival. He said one woman once flew across the country to meet him.<br>
And it makes me a little uncomfortable. It might even piss me off a little. Men like Jimmy are not remarkable. They're not noteworthy. They're doing what they're supposed to be doing--which is not beating up women. If there's any triumph at all, it is in their very averageness. David Adams is skeptical, too, of this potential fetishization our culture has with a good survival story. It's the potential narcissism, again, the charisma they all naturally seem to have in the first place. "They can become charismatic loose cannons," he told me once, "who never really took responsibility for their own abuse."

It's that thing, right, where men[batterers] can relate to wanting their own daughters kept safe, kept from men like themselves, but somehow it doesn't extend to their partners. This view has always sat uncomfortably with me; must we always see ourselves, our own stories, to make someone else's mean something? Can't we just believe that all people should be safe and not just those who resemble our own mothers and daughters? Is relatability necessary for empathy? And there was something else, too, about Jimmy. When I told him I had to talk to Kelly, get her side of the story, talk to his kids, maybe, or his parents, he would go quiet. I talked to his dad once, but his dad didn't seem too happy to see him talking to a reporter. He said so right in front of me. "You gonna talk to her all about you?" he said, gesturing toward me. Jimmy said it was all right, but his father shook his head a little. But then Jimmy just sort of disappeared when it came to me talking to these people, his family. He said he didn't want them re-traumatized, which I understood. We all keep our families safe. But here's the other question I asked: "Why do you get to decide for grown women--daughter, mother, ex-girlfriend--who they can talk to and who they can't?"<br>
That's when Jimmy stopped talking to me.<br>
... Just before we hung up, I asked if she [Jimmy's ex-girlfriend/wife] thought a violent man could ever truly become nonviolent. She thought about it a moment. "I think they can become ninety percent nonviolent. But there's a small part of them that you can never fix."<br>
For his part, Jimmy never spoke to me again.

"I got a lot of people that love me," he says, but in his younger days, he says he wasn't worried about them. How ridiculous it seems to him now. He used to worry about impressing other men, other pimps, other street punk gangsters like he used to be. "I'm worried about the motherfuckers I don't know. I want to be this male-figure motherfucker. And when I'm busy impressing the person I don't know, I'm hurting the people that love me." He says this was his inner hit man. The inner compulsion that tells men to be violent, that hides men from their authentic feelings, that reinforces this male belief system. "We call our image the hit man. Why? 'Cause the hit man moves in silence. The hit man doesn't come outside in the street. He's not driving around in a big ole Cadillac, blasting tunes and smoking a blunt. Motherfucker's out in the suburbs, owns a construction company, you know? Three kids in Catholic schools." He's moving around the room now, bouncing back and forth like he's boxing. Every hit man is different. Depends on the inner lies he makes you believe. Jimmy says his is the "manipulating, womanizing, aggressive bastard." He stops moving. "Every one of those words is deep when you're talking about a crime against your daughters."

Jimmy smiles, says, "Well, you're going to hear it every week, dog. Don't even worry. The work starts at fatal peril. Break that word in two. Fatal means dead, right? Peril. Deadly danger. You know, you're driving down the highway and someone cuts you off and you're like, 'Fuck!' Your hands come up"--he demonstrates with his hands, a defensive posture.<br>
One of the guys says, "Your manhood's been challenged."<br>
...He says how they all learned as little kids that boys don't cry. "Our dad or mom said, 'Don't cry now. Shake it off,' right? Why not? It hurt. Why not cry? What's wrong with crying? Boys didn't get to cry because they were in pain, falling on gravel, but my daughter? Man. She was scooped up and held and kissed, and my son was told to stop crying." He shakes his head. "Now, with the education I got, I'm like, 'Come here, little man. I feel like crying with you. I know that hurt. It's okay. Cry.'"<br>
He talks about how he grew up believing women served men because he watched his grandmother and his female cousins all make the food and bring the food and clean up the food, and the boys sat watching the ball game. What were they all being taught? And now he's a grown man and he knows, because he had to learn, how to feed himself, how to make his own damn omelet.

"Accountability," Jimmy says. Four ways they get into a moment of fatal peril. The first is denial. "I didn't do it. It wasn't me." The next is minimize. "To lessen the impact of my violence," he tells them. Words like "but" and "only" are clues. "I only hit her once. I only pushed her a little. But she came at me first." Blame and collusion are the other two ways. "She hit me first," he says. "She was in my face." That's blame. Collusion is, say another guy is sitting there beside you. "Oh, dog, you going to let her talk to you like that? Yo, man, if I was you, I'd let her know what's what."

When I see Jimmy Espinoza again, several years have gone by. All those months he'd been unable to keep the weight on? All those lunches of giant burritos and refried beans, but he'd stayed skinny as a swizzle stick? Turns out he relapsed. Gone back to drugs. Dove right into the shit he'd worked so hard to pull himself out of. Took himself to a live-in facility just blocks away from the sheriff's outpost where he taught ManAlive. He called me on my cell on a Saturday night. It'd been a tough road, he said, but this time he was determined to keep at it. To stay nonviolent. To kick his drinking. To keep his job. To be better, stronger, tougher at all of it, to admit to his weaknesses and through admitting them, by copping to the struggle, he'd grow stronger. Community Works held his job for him. When I asked him how he felt about the book, whether or not he still wanted me to write about him, he paused on the phone for a moment. Then said, "Fuck yeah. This is the real shit. My life is a struggle every day. Every damn day."<br>
...This is the battle, for him and for all the guys he works with, this pull toward their previous life. Toward drugs, toward the streets, toward the life he used to live. He feels it in his stomach, in his mind. He refers to heroin and coke as princesses, fairy-tale women, Snow White and Cinderella, he calls them. The parallel makes me squirm, but I don't call him on the potential misogyny, because it feels unfair to point this out at the moment when he has the fortitude to take himself to rehab and he is really truly trying. The drugs are beautiful, sexy, gorgeous, beckoning women, women lying on white sheets in soft lighting, calling to him, seducing him. Not three-dimensional, in-your-life women, but temporary lovers. Terrible temptresses, tormentors. He knows that they would offer a moment of ecstasy in exchange for that dread-filled, belly-deep knowledge that comes with failure, with committing violence against his own body, as he might put it.<br>
He's been granted a second chance. And a third. And a fourth. He's lived one life, two, three, seven. He's on his last life, he thinks. He makes vows to the guys in his groups, to his family, to the men and women who live at the treatment center with him, to the batterers and the alcoholics and the users and the addicts, to the man who takes his monthly rent check, to his children and the women he once both loved and abused, and to his coworkers like Reggie and Leo. He vows and vows and vows and most days he gets to the end of the day and feels a kind of bone-deep relief to have made it once more. Of all the vows he offers the vast constellations of people, his deepest vow, he says, is to himself.<br>
He writes on a private Facebook page about the struggle. The seduction of those two. Snow White and Cinderella. How beautiful they are to him. How tantalizing. But he won't succumb. Not this night. And hopefully not the next either. Beyond that, he can't see, or won't look. He's not hibernating, he says. Not hiding out. Just staying away from the places that suck him in, the visceral, associative memories with certain corners in the Haight, certain windows where he can look up and remember entire universes: "This girl, she lived up there in that apartment," he had told me one afternoon, pointing up above a store-front that sold expensive urban menswear, "and I used to sit up there and watch my girls." His girls, it's in the image. Man. Window. Muscles clenched. Response system on high alert. I can picture him as the bear.

Just before I left Donte, after a promise to return and see him, and also to send him some books, Iasked him how he thought of his time at Community Works, back for those few months when he was working with Jimmy out of the sheriff's office, working with violent men but not one of them. That brief respite. His life, for a decade, has been prison, has been surrounded by violence, apart from those few months. It was the first time he remembered being surrounded by people who believed in him, he said. And it made him believe in himself. He summed it up in one word. "Discovery." That's how he saw it. A time of unmitigated "discovery."<br>

When they call their morning meeting, one or another of the guys has to lead the group and when it's his turn, they tell him he talks like a white guy. "I can't help what I know, you feel me?" he says. "The things I learned from Jimmy and Leo. I say shit like 'I feel this' and 'I feel that' and these dudes don't want to intimate with me.

In Massachusetts, I'd been on a call once where a brother had assaulted his sister. She'd come in, crying, to the station to make the report. The officer took her statement, and then offered her a drink of water or a cup of coffee, asked if she'd like to stay at the station for a while just to get ahold of herself (she agreed). Then he talked to her just for a minute or two about familial violence, how hard it could be on people, how it was good she'd come in. Just general stuff. He hadn't done much -- offered her a drink, a minute to gather herself, a statement of empathy. But that is sort of the point. He had done so little and yet still it amounted to an acknowledgment of their shared humanity and in the end would mean so much to her.

Kit Gruelle told me this was the most significant misunderstanding about guns and domestic violence. "[Guns] increase women's danger exponentially," she told me. "Until a gun comes into the relationship, she still feels like she has some capacity to deal with what's going on, whether it's to run, to lock the bedroom door, or whatever." The progun argument that asks women to arm themselves is asking them to behave as their abusers behave, Gruelle notes. Such views have conscripted the narrative, putting the blame on victims for not doing all they could to protect themselves. "It's not a character flaw if [women] don't have a natural tendency to turn and fire on the father of [their] children," she said. Gruelle told me that if she had ever pulled a gun on her abusive husband "he'd have taken it away and laughed at it."

And it strikes me that this is why O'Hanlon[a domestic violence abuser who killed his wife and daughter] agreed to talk to me at all, to try to find some way to live with himself in this world. The tutoring, the letter writing, the Bible studying. Clawing his own way out of the darkness just enough to get through each hour of each day. This is the state of purgatory in which he will reside in this life: trying to extricate his pain through a thousand small gestures and kindnesses and prayers from that one colossal, horrifying moment.<br>
There is a narrative that emerges with Patrick O'Hanlon, of not giving up, of determination and persistence. It is a peculiarly American narrative of hard work and defying rejection before, finally at long last, the inevitable success that was promised all along. But what if the key to all this isn't hard work, isn't dogged determination, but rather resilience in one's own failure, the grace to accept defeat and move on? What might have been had Patrick O'Hanlon chosen another path? Gone into real estate [after retiring, instead of a menial job in his opinion]? Become a software engineer? It's the kind of question most of us ask about our own lives. How decision X led to action Y. A chance encounter. A flip decision. A left rather than right and it might have all unfolded so, so differently.

In a now famous TED talk called "Listening to Shame," Brene Brown, who calls herself a "vulnerability researcher," talked about the correlation of shame with violence, depression, and aggression, among others. She said shame is "organized by gender." For women, it's about a competing set of expectations around family, work, relationships; for men it's simply, "do not be perceived as... weak." Calling shame "an epidemic in our culture," Brown cites the research of James Mahalik at Boston College, who studied what our ideas were of gender norms across American society. For women those norms involved "nice, thin, modest, and use all available resources for appearance." For men, the norms included "show emotional control, work is first, pursue status, and violence."<br>
...Even in Hollywood's portrayal of men, violence is "a prominent part of moviegoing," he said. "Somehow we've equated violence with problem-solving."<br>
...He has learned that having a bit of humility is actually strengthening rather than weakening... Low risk for self-harm or harm to others.<br>
If you ask O'Hanlon[a domestic violence offender] why he did it, he'll say he does not know. If you ask him what advice he'd offer in terms of prevention, his answers vary. And I asked him every time I ever spoke to him. Here is a compilation of what he said over the course of our interviews: "Don't take on too much. Don't be prideful. Don't be greedy for promotion, for financial gain. Don't work so hard. Lower your expectations. Don't be too ambitious. September 11th. We need to address how we treat mental illness in this country. We need to look at the medication they're taking. Survivor's guilt. I should have read the Book of Job. You don't know how far I drive on my commute, what my life is like. Insomnia. When you have cancer, you can ask your friend for help. Not so with depression."<br>
The thing is, he's not really wrong about any of this.

Wile's remark reminded me of a woman I'd met once just as she was managing to get her life back together after years of abuse. One of the questions that is so difficult to really explain is how abuse slowly erodes a person, how often survivors talk about emotional abuse being so much worse than physical abuse. Indeed, Gondolf's book talks about domestic violence as a process, rather than a single incident, and yet our entire criminal justice system is set up to address incidents, not processes. This particular woman had a social work background, and I spent many hours with her as she tried to explain how her ex-husband's abuse just whittled away at her. The first time, she said, was so sudden and so strange she assumed it was just a onetime event. They'd been walking on a busy Manhattan street, arguing, when he suddenly leaned over and bit her on the cheek so hard that half her face bruised up and she had teeth marks for days. When he saw what he had done, he took her to the drugstore to buy makeup to cover it. Like so many others, he claimed to be deeply remorseful. Horrified by what he'd done. He cried. He apologized. He made promises. "I was still like, this is unacceptable," she told me, "before I had just got so broken down and it was just about survival." And yet he continued to abuse her, escalating the abuse year after year. He'd throw golf balls at her face as she drove down the highway, or toss a blanket over her head and strangle her. By the time things had reached the level where she feared for her life, he could go to the store on his own, buy the makeup she needed to cover up his assult, and present it to her without apology. By then, she says, she was so beaten down as a person she felt as if there was nothing left, a husk of skin and bone with no spirit, no agency of her own, only a kind of slow, painful slog toward unconsciousness. And yet, at the same time, she felt if she could only help hin see himself through her eyes, he'd change, become the person she'd always felt him capable of being. It's a common narrative. Women are given the message over and over that we are the holders of the emotional life and health of the family, that the responsibility for a man to change lies, in fact, with us. "The only way that I can really describe what happened to me is like part of me, like, died, and then part of me got ignited in terms of, like, my love will heal us," she said. "But I had to stop loving myself and only love him." His narcissism, in other words, didn't even allow the room for her to care for herself.<br>
She was ashamed by the turn her life and marriage had taken, so much so that she didn't admit it to anyone for a long time. After all, she told herself, she had a promising career and a graduate degree; she'd been raised to "know better" by a feminist. She wasn't impoverished. She wasn't uneducated. She was liberal, middle class, white. She had long blond hair, a white-toothed California smile. And still, here she was, with this man who'd somehow carved away the humanity in her. The abuse must have somehow been partly her fault, she thought. He had post-traumatic stress disorder. She needed to be more patient. He'd fought for his country, serving in overseas wars. She owed it to him, she told herself. Hadn't everyone else in the world given up on him? Wasn't she the only person he really had? Wasn't that the promise she'd made him? Love, honor, sickness, health, poverty, wealth. It was her duty to stay, to help him see clear to fixing his own pain. She couldn't imagine what he'd been through. Where was her empathy? Her patience? Someday, somehow, she thought he'd get better and the abuse would end and it would all be okay.<br>
And then one day she woke up and she fled. And her case was so extreme that she qualified for a witness protection program that kept her address confidential, that had her mail delivered by private courier, that installed security cameras at her doors and windows. It took her years to return to herself. Years where he was put on a GPS ankle bracelet and given a lifetime restraining order and barred from even entering the county, never mind the town, where she lived and worked. He did jail time. And eventually, several years after she left him, she did something she'd forgotten she once loved: she went jogging. Outside. In the open air. And that was when she knew she was really free.

When Adams first began studying how to change the behavior of abusive men, before he'd made the connections to narcissism, nearly all the research from the 1960s and '70s described violence in the home as the product of a manipulative woman who incited her husband. That victims provoke their own abuse is an attitude that persists today. In the early 1980s, Ellen Pence, a domestic violence advocate in Minnesota created the Power and Control Wheel. The Wheel highlights the eight ways a batterer maintains power and control: fear, emotional abuse, isolation, denial and blame, using children, bullying, financial control, and brute force and verbal threats. Advocates point out that abusers don't walk around with a conscious notion that they're seeking power and control. Instead, they say things like, "I just want her to be sweet [obedient and subservient] and have dinner on the table at six." Or, "I just want her to have the house cleaned, and the kids in bed." Or, "I just pushed her a little. She's overreacting." Or, "I wouldn't have broken that plate if she hadn't screamed." All of these are variations on the same thing.(Later, I would hear Jimmy Espinoza tell a group of men to be on guard for the words "just," "if," and "but," which seemed to me a fairly decent summation.)<br>
...For Adams this extreme narcissism is at the root of understanding batterers, and while we may think of narcissists as conspicuous misfits who can't stop talking about themselves, in fact they are often high-functioning, charismatic, and professionally successful. The narcissists are "hiding among us," Adams says, "and they're clustered at the top." Such people are not easy to identify, in part because they have outsized people skills, and "we live in a world that is increasingly narcissistic. We extrol success more than we extol anything," he says. Adams points to the kind of "charismatic narcissist who is worshipped by others." This is the kind of white-collar batterer who--through money and connections--manages to evade judicial and law enforcement systems. A man for whom status and reputation are everything. He and other researchers I spoke with often talk about our collective vision of criminals, especially murderers; how we tend to picture rageaholics when the reality is that they are impossible to divine from the general population.

Adams asks the seven [domestic violence offenders] to rate their fathers as "good," "bad," or "mixed." Of the seven, only one rates his father as "bad." Yet they tell stories of fathers with alcohol addictions, of fathers bloodying their mothers, of belts taken to them throughout their childhoods. I sit there listening, amazed that they fail to see either themselves or their mothers as victims of their fathers. It struck me in such a specific way at that moment, how men and women truly see and decode the world so differently. Of course, I'd experienced this in my own life, in moments with my then-husband--I remember saying to him, on so many occasions when he'd claim I wasn't listening to him, that I was indeed listening. What I was doing was disagreeing. But sitting there that night, maybe because I was on the outside of these lives looking in rather than trying to argue a point from inside my own life, the concrete illustration of this abstract idea somehow chilled me. I remember thinking it was a marvel that anyone stayed married for the long haul.<br>
At several points, Adams has to remind them that they can love their fathers and still be critical. Over and over, the men talk about how their mothers had provoked their fathers.

The fact that only 55% of the men who go through Emerge actually complete the program is a sign of its rigor and efficacy, Adams says. "I'm always distrustful of programs that complete higher numbers. It's like bad schools. They graduate everybody."<br>
... Seven men file in and sit in folding chairs, joking around uncomfortably with one another... It is my first time sitting in on an offenders' group... I still carry a picture in my mind of an abuser who is a rageaholic, a monster, a person visibly and uncontrollably angry. Someone easily identifiable as a "bad guy." I may even have operated under the idea that my own gut instincts would alert me to such a man. And what strikes me immediately--in fact, deeply unsettles me in a way--is how incredibly normal they all seem. Like a bunch of guys I'd go have a beer with. They are charming. They are funny, gregarious, shy, high-strung. Good-looking or not, well-dressed or not. They are Everyman. One of the hallmarks of domestic violence, Adams told me, is this false idea that abusers are somehow angry generally; rather, their anger is targeted--at a partner or at the partners's immediate family. As a result, friends and acquaintances of abusers are often surprised to hear that they committed an assault. "The most surprising thing is that [abusers] seem like such normal guys," says Adams. "The average batterer is pretty likable." For Adams this is the whole point: that we look for talons and tails, but find instead charm and affability. It's how abusers attract victims in the first place. "We look for the rageaholic," Adams says. But only about a quarter of batterers fit that definition. What he sees, is an inflexible personality. "A rigid black-or-white thinker is what I most imagine," Adams says.

One day, early on, Adams told me the story of a woman who brought in a recording of her abusive husband to his group. On the tape, the husband said things like, "I wouldn't have such anger and rage if I weren't so crazy in love with you." It was the first time he really heard and understood how manipulative abusers could be. How they romanticized both their abuse and their jealousy. The "I love you so much you make me this way" excuse. The "I wouldn't do X if you didn't do Y" rationalization. Blame and denial. Adams and other researchers point out the framework of these kinds of sentiments. They minimize the violence, rationalizing abusive behavior and blaming the victim. And it works. The trifecta is cyclical: minimizing, rationalizing, blaming. And then comes the remorse. The deep, tearful apology, the promises of better behavior, the adoration and claims of love. The script is strikingly similar no matter who's saying it.<br>
... Here is a small sampling of things [a domestic violence offender] said to [his wife/gf]:<br>
"Give me one more chance. One more. Jail's not worth it. This shit ain't worth it."<br>
"You're blowing it out of proportion. I was just fucking with you. I wasn't trying to kill you... Why you keep fighting me instead of helping me get outta here? Why ain't you apologizing, too, for staying out all night?"<br>
"I am in love with you, bitch, and I wish I wasn't, 'cause you're putting me through fucking misery. Why you doing this to me?"<br>
"I don't owe you no explanation... You done nothing but put me in jail. You ain't sent no letters or pictures. I don't care if you come to court on me. I ain't call you no more."<br>
"You don't got to come to court. They talk about me, you tell them to shut the fuck up. They lying to you. Just tell them you're going to file for a dismissal. Don't let the prosecutor give you another chance to come to court."<br>
"You ain't gotta sign. Don't answer the door... I trust you. I don't think you're doing anything. You're not dumb enough."<br>
"Let's go down there and make it official. I believe in marriage. It's a commitment for life, dude... Wait till I get out. I have people watching you."<br>
Blame, minimize, rationalize, and apology and promise: they were all right there, laid out in his words. The coercion, the manipulation, the emotional and verbal abuse, the threats, the dehumanizing. His attempts to make her believe that he is stronger than the system, that he knows more than the system. The tapes went on for more than an hour in court that day, far more than what I've included here, and in that time I noticed this, too: he failed to use her proper name even once.

His work in those early days led Adams to write a dissertation that tried to dissect what happened in abusive households that didn't happen in households where there was no abuse... Where the two groups tended to differ was that the non-abusers knew they were getting a good deal and appreciated and acknowledged their wives' double shifts, whereas the abusers would say things like, "I do a lot more than most men, but does she appreciate that?" Adam's research showed that the abuser's perspective was that they "weren't being appreciated for what they did, rather than what their wives were doing." Non-abusers, on the other hand, "would say things like 'I'm lucky. My wife does a lot.' And that acknowledgment meant a lot to the wives." Abusers also tended to be more critical of their wives' housekeeping.<br>
What Adams realized, then, was that the clinical narcissism of these men kept them from being able to really see how their behavior impacted their victims. "Narcissism filters how they see everything," Adams told me.<br>
...[Adam] has... like many who work in the social services field, his own story of childhood violence. An abusive, emotionally stunted father. A mother who looked away... [Adams] stood at the edge that day with [his grandmother] as she pointed to one of the tiny dots--men working deep in the hole--and she said, "That's your daddy, there." Adams told her no, his daddy was much bigger. It was impossible, that tiny little speck of a person, no bigger than an ant from his vantage at the edge. But then eventually he got the point. How very small his father was, how he could be a different man than his father had been. It was one of the most lasting and profound lessons of his life, something that today he calls his greatest gift from his grandmother. As he grew up, he made it his mission to be as different as possible from his father, who belittled education and thought boys should be tough. Adams kept his face in a book for two decades, until that education so despised by his father could offer him an escape. "Kids are quite literal," Adams said to me, "and it was a revelation that I didn't have to be like him."

[Donte] had no money for a decent lawyer. His chances, as I saw them, were nil. He'd wind up just another violent man fated to the life he'd always known, carried along by forces he couldn't fight alone. As far as I could tell, Donte had been honest with me. He didn't pretend to be a good guy. He knew he'd fucked up. And he'd told me, too, how impossible it was to live on an intern's paycheck in San Francisco. When his time at the halfway house was over, he'd planned to move back to his mother's house, smack in the middle of the neighborhood that set him on his troublesome road so many years earlier, not because he wanted to, but because he had no choice. Of course, I thought. Of course he had a rock of crack in his pocket. What else is he going to do? He's got a job, and a seven p.m. curfew. Community Works, Jimmy Espinoza, RSVP, they were all doing everything they could for Donte Lewis, but they were all also fighting the same systems with their other priorities, and with racism and classism embedded into their architecture, with limited resources and limitless need.<br>
...He thought he'd just do a couple of little cash deals with some crack and get a small jump start on his finances. Nothing big. Nothing that was going to take him off his antiviolence program. That night, he had a little baggie in his pocket. Way he saw it, there was no other way he could ever hope to get out of his mother's house for a long, long time. He was twenty-eight already, pretty old to be living at home.

Before the leave for the night, Jimmy asks the group about intimating. About how to be intimate. It's something they'll learn more in another stage of the curriculum. Doug says, "Listen and disclose." The "listen" means listening to their partners, but also listening to themselves, their feelings, their own bodies.<br>
Donte thanks Doug for his courage, sitting up there at the head of the circle for hours, having one of his worst moments laid bare for a group of strangers. "Seeing the expressions on your face. Them was the same expressions on my face 'cause I really hurt somebody that I loved--you feel me? So I want to say thank you for doing the work. I really want you to see the violence that you did to the person you supposed to love. Thanks, bro."

Donte chimes in. "When you said you had decided you all were going to be like friends, that to me sounds like denial." Doug nods. He wanted her back. He was denying his own feelings. "When you say 'I've never been so drunk in my life' that kinda sounds to me like blame. And you said she came at you--that's kinda like blame again." Blaming the liquor. Blaming her. Blaming everything and everyone but himself. Doug acknowledges that Donte is right.<br>
They go on in this way for another twenty minutes. One of the guys points out his body language when the police showed up, how Doug was sitting there on the curb waiting for them, trying, as he said, "to make myself look as harmless as possible." That sounded like "minimizing," the guy told Doug. So Doug was in denial about his own feelings, and his own part in the violence. He blamed her and blamed the other guy, and he threatened them verbally and physcially, and he minimized his role in all of it, and it's all right there in what his body did and what his words were.<br>
Perhaps the most significant challenge to this entire program is that men who've gone through it--either RSVP or ManAlive--are still operating in the same world as before they went through the program. The guys in San Bruno? They have it so much easier than the guys who are in the outside world, trying to live a nonviolent life where everything and everyone around them hasn't changed. Donte talked to me about this earlier in the day, how his mother and grandmother saw the change in him, but also didn't trust it. How even he himself didn't trust it. And he didn't have any kind of equation for how to even out the imbalance of his life, except time.<br>
My own thoughts: Sometimes, like here, people don't take the blame when they should. Other times, people, like rape victims, blame themselves, when they shouldn't. Sometimes it's our fault and sometimes it isn't. Gotta learn when it is and when it isn't, or when it partly is or not or when it mostly is or isn't.

Drinking is "self-violence." Calling names is "verbal violence." Punching walls is "physical violence."<br>
...In the pedagogy of ManAlive, the male role belief system is what society tells men to expect. In group, Jimmy or Sinclair or whoever is leading will often stop and ask the participants to offer some examples of the male role belief system: man does not get disrespected. Man does not get lied to. Man's sexuality does not get questioned. Man is the authority. Man does not get dismissed. Woman should be submissive, obedient, supportive to man. When a man's belief system is challenged, he goes into fatal peril and that is the moment where violence is a choice. ManAlive uses a kind of hokey phrase for this moment: when a man's "inner hit man" comes out and his "authentic self" disappears. A hit man operates in silence, alone. A hit man blends into a crowd, destroys people in stealth, then disappears. A hit man takes no responsibility. A hit man has no moral center. Jimmy points out to Doug that when he is in a moment of fatal peril, Doug is not only noticing his partner, he is also no longer noticing himself, his own feelings, his own needs, his own body. He is simply reacting to the challenge that's been made to his belief system, and it's in this kernel of conflict where a decision to become violent or not resides. One man who'd gone through the program said he had learned to literally take a step backward to try to recalibrate his mind and his body in such a moment. Sometimes an adjustment this small is all they need to remind themselves to stop, take a breath, don't escalate.

Regardless, this is when he found RSVP and he learned about what he'd done, to himself, to Kelly and their daughter, to his community, to the rest of his family. He tells the guys in his group how violence has a ripple effect, how he hurt Kelly, which hurt his children, his parents, her circle of friends, and on and on. Violence is a darkness that migrates into a community, infects it so that it multiplies. When Donte talks about East Oakland as Baghdad, I think this is what he means, exactly what Jimmy is talking about. How one violent act by one person begets another. How violence matched with more violence never really solves any kind of problem. I have an ex-husband who spent his entire career in the military and he used to say to me that the problem with having a gun, no matter who you are, is that its presence authomatically puts you on a side. You are no longer neutral. Violence, it seems to me, does the same thing. It splinters individual people, yes, but it also splinters families, communities, cities, countries. This is what Jimmy is trying to get at with his own story.<br>
...He tells this story with a shake of his head, the remorse threading itself through his body language. How many women across time? I think. How many have pled this same sentence? Women around the world, in a thousand languages, across the centuries, the span of human existence. Please don't kill me. See how polite we women are? We say "please" when we're begging for our lives.

And Donte and Jimmy push Doug to drive home the point. What would this look like to someone else in that room? This fist-clenching, heart-racing, stiff-postured person?<br>
It would look intimidating.<br>
It would look scary.<br>
It would look bad.<br>
That's the beginning: notice your body.<br>
Next comes language. Some of this becomes obvious immediately. Substituting a slur for a partner's name, for example. But language in general is more subtle than this. It works at both the conscious and subconscious levels. Painfully, word by word, second by second they go. Don't say "pussy." Don't swear. Don't say "my old lady." Don't say "ho," "slut," "woman." Use proper names. Use the term "partner." Maintain eye contact with the person you're speaking to or with the group. Sit up straight. No slumping. When describing the incidents that landed them in the place they're in at the moment, they have to use "I" statements, possessive pronouns. It's not "our" violence or "men's" violence or "society's" violence. It's "my" violence. Own your violence. Be accountable for your violence.<br>
When they do this excersie in San Bruno, it may take an entire morning. Hours to deconstruct an event that in real life may have been just a couple of minutes long. The guys don't have to pick the inciting incident that landed them in jail, though most do. They are asked to notice every little detail that they can possibly remember: their body language, their heart rate, their breath, their muscles, their tone of voice, their words, their feelings, the sounds and smells. One day sitting in Jimmy's group at San Bruno, he asked them how long they thought it took them to get from yelling at their partners to being in the back of that cop car? The guys gruessed twenty minutes, twenty-five minutes, half an hour, maybe an hour. "No," Jimmy told them. "Ten minutes. Bam! There you go, brother." Minutes to go from a man to a bear to an inmate. But tonight, with Doug, they do the whole exercise in under two hours.<br>
We coerce, Jimmy tells them. They coerce themselves, their victims, their kids. It's taking them away from themselves. Jimmy says they have to be willing to take action. That awareness plus action equals change. I can see him looking around the group, guy to guy. "I'm going to speak on that for one fucking second," Jimmy says, standing up. "I've been aware of shit my whole life. I'm aware of everything that I ever did in my life. Lying, cheating, stealing. I heard 'Don't sell drugs' all my life. 'Don't do drugs, don't put your hands on girls.' I heard that all my life, but I did it anyway." A guy with his elbows on his knees sits back in his chair. "This is important, guys. How do I get the willingness to stop my violence?" He waits a beat, looks around the circle. "If I don't look at the destruction that I caused, then I'm not going to give a fuck."

"My girl went to another pimp once," Jimmy says. "I raped her. That's terrible. That is terrible, bro. You have feelings. This isn't you. But it was you that day."<br>
..."I fed off women who had no dads, women who were sexually assaulted," Jimmy tips back on the legs of his chairs for a moment, then slams back down. "And then I stole their souls."<br>
This nudging, the language, the gentle urging to keep with the story is part of the curriculum. It shows how language matters, how much we can lie to ourselves, take ourselves off track to avoid responsibility, how we use words to frame our guilt or innocence, how easy it is to manipulate and how so often that manipulation starts inside our own minds, how we can minimize our impact on someone else. Later, the group will be harder on Doug, but for now, they let him talk.<br>
...Donte chimes in about the name-calling. "Listen, man, in order for me to put my hands on her, she's not Ashley anymore. She's a slut. You gotta rename her, see what I'm sayin'?"

They focus on just one man tonight, named Doug, as he recounts the single primary event that got him in trouble. Sinclair used to call this exercise the Destruction Cycle, but he renamed it the Separation Cycle because the pedagogical point to him was that it's meant to show how a person separates from what Sinclair calls his "authentic self" in a threatening moment, and it's this separation that allows for violence to happen.<br>
...[Jimmy] never wants anyone to suffer through traffic. And traffic is like violence: there's always another avenue to take to avoid it.<br>
Jimmy addresses the rest of the group. "I need you guys to stay focused right now," he says. "Don't collude if you hear something that to you appears to be funny. He may describe how he assaulted his partner and you laugh and he may shut down. What we did to our partners is not funny, so let's be delicate with that. Let's treat that in a mature manner. This work is serious. It's not funny."<br>
..."I need, like ten seconds," Doug says. I can see his hands slightly tremble as he holds them between his legs.<br>
"Just breathe, man," Jimmy says. "Just let yourself know you're alive."

Another one laughs, says, "Check it out. Fatal peril club right here." They understand fatal peril as the exact instant when a man's sense of expectation is most threatened. What the world owes him, what his own sense of self demands. Something challenges him--maybe his partner says something, or does something, and he reacts. Maybe a guy in a bar insults him. Maybe some coworker tells him he fucked up. It's a split second that changes everything. Eyes narrow, chests pump, fists clench, muscles tense, blood rushes. The body language is almost universal, running across race and class and culture, sometimes even species. A man, a lion, a bear. The body reacts the same way. Fatal peril. A moment that, Jimmy and Donte hope to eventually show these men, is a decision. Violence as a learned behavior. We don't know it, but we have another word for fatal peril. "Snap." On the news, the mourning neighbor, the crying coworker: he just snapped. But the snap is a smoke screen, a cliche, a fiction. The snap doesn't exist.

Many of us on the outside of such a world tend to see something like intimate partner violence in a silo, a problem all its own that needs addressing all its own. Social service interventions have tended to treat such problems singularly, too. But a home with intimate partner violence might also have child abuse, alcoholism, and employment or housing instability. Traumatic brain injury or other serious medical conditions might be present. Education may not be a priority or may not be available or may be compromised. Treating just one of these doesn't mitigate the issues that arise from the others. Treatment programs, not to mention research, are understanding this more and more, that problems are multidimensional and thus treatment must be, too.

The odds were against Donte, and he knew it. "The old me got a whole lot more ammunition than the new me," he said. The simplicity and the truth of his statement stuck with me. He, too, spoke like he was still in the gang, still working the streets, but then every onece in a while, he'd shoot out some unexpected phrase that showed the new him... he was in the middle of the story of how he and his homies called women "bitch." Girlfriends, yes, but even sisters and mothers were bitches. Sometimes, "my old lady." No woman had an identity; no woman had a name. "By calling her a 'bitch' all the time," he said, suddenly, "what I was really doing was taking away her humanity."<br>
...They meet here in groups weekly, and if they make it to the end, they'll have spent a year on what boils down to trying to teach these men self-awareness: of who they become and what they look like when they're violent, of how their violence affects those around them, and of alternative responses to stressful situations.

[Donte] spoke of his past with both fear and awe. In East Oakland, where he'd grown up, the culture was "music, big rims, guns, and killin'." If you didn't have a thirty-round clip on a Glock, then you weren't a man, he told me. Violence was a way of life. even if you didn't want to be part of it, it was impossible to stay neutral. No one had a choice. He called it Baghdad. Said it was war all the time. He saw this now as part of the "male role belief system."<br>
...[Donte had] never thought of how he was treating [his girlfriend], never thought of gendered stereotypes or how culture played into his actions. In prison, while he was going through the RSVP program, he'd read the book Emotional Intelligence and begun taking classes in psychology and sociology. He had a seven p.m. curfew while he was on probation now, but he said he didn't mind. It dept him off the streets at night when the temptations were great. But it was hard to live. His internship paid him just about $700 a month after taxes, he said. He had a cast on one arm because he'd punched someone about a split second after his release from jail and had nearly lost the Community Works internship. He claimed to be deeply sorry for having done it, and the cast was a visual reminder, he said, of how big the battle was--the violent versus the nonviolent him, past versus present, ignorant versus knowledgeable. he had big dreams. He wanted to finish his community college degree, then maybe his bachelor's. He wondered about becoming a psychologist. What would that be like? Could that even be something that was possible? Could he eventually help other guys like him?

Jimmy starts off by asking them about emotional abuse. Do they understand what it means? How it's perpetrated? So much of the class simply helping men identify and experience their feelings: fear, sadness, empathy, shame, even anger. It's not wrong to feel things; it's wrong to feel things and then purposely avoid them, is the point. Jimmy asks them, "Why will drug addiction affect your family?"<br>
"Because we're not there even when we're there," one man says. He's in his midfifties, African American, hair gone gray. "We're manipulating their time and energy. They call us and we don't answer... We manipulate the space in their hearts."<br>
The man beside him nods, his braided hair tied up in a massive knot. "I snapped on this bitch, but I came on drugs." What he means is that his loyalty was to drugs and not his partner. He sought out a high before he bothered paying any kind of attention to her. He's giving an example of how he used to think, before he knew what he knows now.<br>
"I did a lot of emotional abuse without putting my hands on [my partner]," a man named Devon says. "I used to go drinking and I took myself away from her. I started doing drugs and she'd cry. I'd be gone for days. I minimized her."<br>
In ManAlive, drugs and alcohol aren't excuses for violence, Jimmy says. "I'm a drug addict. I'm a batterer. Me not coming home is violence toward the family. I'm not beating them, but I'm still affecting them. You're self-separating first." In the background, I can hear the guys from Bruenn's group talking, but the fourteen in this circle have their eyes trained on Jimmy. It's calm and quiet; a complete departure from the kind of chaos depicted of most jails in movies.<br>
...Jimmy: The molestation from the man was worst. That right there made me violent. Made me a rageaholic, right? Lying, right? Just all these defects of character started growing at that moment.<br>
I look around the room, fourteen men in jail staring him down as he tells this story. Half of them are nodding, partly from empathy. Partly from experience.

This contradicts the role of most journalists, but part of the point of the course for these men is that we are all from the same community, and we share the same burdens: the need to be loved, the fear of vulnerability, the suffocating weight of shame.<br>
...Many of them later thank me for sharing a little of my life, and it leaves me feeling a sense of vulnerability that, despite being a woman in relative touch with her feelings, is unnerving and uncomfortable. Even here, writing it, I feel shame.<br>
I wonder at how difficult public vulnerability must be for these guys. I didn't grow up being told not to cry, being told not to be a sissy, being told that I had to win, and if I didn't win, I had to fight to become the winner. I was told other things, yes. Certainly. Many of the same kinds of things that Michelle Monson Mosure was told. About what girls should be and do, and how girls should act. I was told that men were the head of the house and women subordinate. But sharing some of the most shameful moments? The most embarrassing moments? James Gilligan, the violence researcher who'd evaluated the RSVP program initially, told me that for many of these guys it's not becoming nonviolent that blows their minds about themselves; it's learning that they've been fed a line about what they're supposed to act like and who they're supposed to be, a line about what masculinity means and what being a man means. How as men they can acknowledge anger, rage and authority. But not empathy, kidness, love, fear, pain, sadness, care, nurture or any of those other "traits" that are deemed feminine. And that they've been manipulated by forces larger than themselves, shaped by a world they had never thought about in this way, which is shocking to them. What a relief to learn they've been coerced into their violence, not born into it.

It also looks good in court if you can show a judge you're trying to change. But it's also this other thing, so obvious it rarely gets mentioned: people don't want to be in violent situations. When I'm told, as I often am, that violence is simply human nature, I think of San Bruno and wonder, if that's true, then why, given the choice, do people deemed so violent they must be locked away from civil society, try to put themselves first and foremost in a section known for its lack of violence?

The day they learned of the muder, Schwartz told me she walked into the jail and everyone was "crying hysterically, uncontrollably." It was a moment of crisis for the entire program, but it didn't shake her belief in the work and in its urgency. "This stuff is too delicate and compelling to pretend that any one thing is the answer," she said. "I think of the cancer analogy. You have people going through chemotherapy and then someone dies. Does that mean you stop your clinical trial?" You keep at it, keep tweaking, keep developing, keep trying new combinations. "That's what this is," she said. "It's a clinical trial."

Sunny Schwartz: Why isn't [RSVP] the rule rather than the exception? What pisses me off so much is the lack of imagination we tend to have for people who haven't had the same experience we have. As if lives are synonymous.<br>
It frustrates Schwartz that there are so few resources available to those coming out of the RSVP program and back into civil society. Things like job training, meditation, parenting classes, alcoholics and narcotics anonymous, housing support, twelve-step programs, art and humanities therapies, and educational opportunities. These guys go through RSVP, she told me, and they learn all this stuff about gender, about themselves, about culture and society and violence and communication, and then they walk back into a world in which all of that theory is real again, and all of those challenges are real again, plus all of those threats and all of that pain, and they're just more or less on their own.<br>
...Prison creates more violence in our communities, not less. And so, Schwartz asked me, "What is our alternative?" She told me an anecdote that had stayed with her for years, a story that was equal parts call to action and reason to hope. It was about a Holocaust survivor who, in the midst of being beaten by a guard, never stopped smiling. It infuriated the guard. The guard hit him harder and harder, until finally, he stopped and asked the prisoner why he was smiling. He said, "I am grateful, because I am not like you."

[The violent offenders] begin to see, some of them for the first time ever, the effect their violence may have had on their victims. That is to say, they begin to see the world through someone else's eyes.<br>
"Now imagine," a facilitator named Reggie says to them, "if that was your child up there where Victoria was standing. What would your kid say about you?"<br>
Challenging gender norms, specifically how men and women are conditioned by social and cultural standards, and how men are taught violence to solve their problems and women are supposed to be subservient to their men, was at the core of the curriculum. For many of the men, it flipped everything they thought they knew about their world.

Locking up men punitively wasn't doing anything to change the reasons they got locked up in the first place.<br>
After years with these men, she began to think that vilence was something that could be reduced if prison became a place not to toss away and forget those who broke the law, but a place to reform them. There were two philosophical pillars to her program. The first was the ManAlive curriculum: an intervention in the cycle of violence passed down from man to man, father to son to son to son. But she wanted more. The second pillar was the concept of restorative justice. Restorative justice insists that the perpetrator acknowledge the pain and suffering he has caused and "restore" his victims and community as much as possible. Reconciliation is the primary goal, through offenders meeting with domestic violence victims. Though restorative justice sometimes means an offender is meeting with his or her specific victim, in the context of San Bruno, general victims of domestic violence are brought in weekly to talk about their experiences and about what it means to live with and beyond trauma.

[Sinclair] tells me about an antiviolence conference he attended some years ago where a presenter was asked about a family who encouraged their child to go back to his harasser and beat him up. The target of the fight was a boy. The child of the family in question was a boy. The parent offering the advice was the father. (It is the rare mother who would exhort her son to "go back out there and beat him up.") So here was a father advocating that the solution to his young son's problem of violence was more violence; his solution reinforced the male-role belief system, recycling it to yet another young man. Violence begetting violence begetting violence. But none of the participants at the conference even mentioned the gender dynamics of this scenario, Sinclair said. Instead, the focus was on the anecdoate itself, the possible result of the fight, but not the gendered exhortation in the first place. Sinclair points to this as "part of the problem." Ths refusal to see or acknowledge the gendered source of violence. The whos as much as the whys. Violence, he says, is not a "relationship problem. It is a problem of [a woman's] partner's commitment to violence."<br>
"Violent men are aware that they are violent and even take pride in the manliness of it to their friends," he said. "But, they will often deny that their violence is actually violent when questioned. Their denial allows violent men to minimize the impact of their violence on their victims, blame them for it, and ask their families and friends to collude with them by approving it." What he means is that incidents of violence are downplayed: perpetrators tend to use phrases like "it wasn't that bad." They accuse victims of overreacting. They claim they didn't mean to "hurt" her when they three that household item in her general direction or slammed that door on her or tossed her against a wall. As if the objects--wall, door--were to blame. These men do everything they can not to own an act as violent.

I thought of a field trip to see Camelot with my daughter's school that I chaperoned not long ago. Fourth graders from all over the city attended. After the performance the actors came out on stage for a Q&A and the moderator, who worked at the theater, asked the kids two questions: one, do you think Guenevere was wrong to allow her feelings for Lancelot to lead to a betrayal of her husband, King Arthur? And, two, should King Arthur have forgiven Lancelot or executed him? To the first question, the kids hollered, collectively, that yes, she was wrong. She should have ignored her feelings. To the second, the boys' voices erupted in a massive prepubescent holler, "Yes! Kill him! Kill him!" These were children growing up in the liberal enclave of Washington, D.C., children with two working parents in families that often defy gender norms from the day they're born. And yet, the audience was asked only about the female character's feelings, not the male's--as if Lancelot and Arthur were devoid of human emotion. And when the choice to forgive or avenge arose, the answer feel squarely along gendered lines. The boys said kill, unequivocally. Fourth graders had already gotten the message, even in spite of their liberal surroundings. (It was a great disappointment to me that none of the adults--not the teachers, not the actors, not the chaperones--took the opportunity to address this gendered view. Indeed, I'm not at all sure that anyone but me noticed it.)

It is men who are violent. It is men who perpetrate the majority of the world's violence, whether that violence is domestic abuse or war. Even those relatively few women who are violent, he says, are most often violent in response to men's violence. Indeed, this is the single most effective argument I know for why it doesn't make sense to arm women with guns to protect them against men with guns: because arming a woman with a gun is asking her to behave like a man, to embody the somatic and psychological and cultural experience of a man while simultaneously quelling all that women have been taught. It says to women, if you want to protect yourself from violent men, you need to become violent yourself. To Sinclair, this is exactly the wrong way to the solution. It's not women who need to learn violence; it's men who need to learn nonviolence.<br>
If men are taught not to cry, women are taught crying is acceptable. If men are taught anger is their sole allowable emotion, women are taught never to be angry. Men who yell are being men; women who yell are shrill or they're drama queens or they're hysterical. (Many before me have pointed out that there is no greater "drama" than a mass shooting, but the term "drama kings" hasn't yet captured the popular lexicon, however accurate.) Sinclair calls this "the elephant in the room." That we won't say, simply, that it is men who are violent. It is men who take their violence out on masses of others. School shootings are carried out by young men. Mass murders. Gang warfare, murder-suicides and familicides and matricides and even genocides: all men. Always men. "Every commonly available domestic violence and official general violence statistic, and every anecdotal account about domestic and all other kinds of violence through the United States and around the world, point clearly to the fact that men almost monopolize all sectors of violence perpetration," Sinclair wrote. "The generic descriptions of violence seem to be a careful attempt not to see this crucial piece of evidence... a careful way of avoiding the gendered source of violence. This error in analysis will mislead us in our attempt to find solutions to the problem."

[Sinclair] began to understand violence as the result of a belief system men all seemed to share, which told them they were the authority in their lives, that they were to be respected, obeyed. Top of the human hierarchy. It was a belief system that not only distanced them from people around them, but also limited their range, kept them boxed in by their own narrow ideas of what men could be and how men could behave.<br>
But why? Why did men believe this? Sinclair understands, of course, the arguments about human evolution, how we must kill to survive (to eat, he means). He's willing to believe that maybe at some point, far back in human history, men had some kind of predisposition toward violence in order to feed their families. But no longer, not today, and not for many hundreds of years. Beyond this history, he rejects the notion that violence is inherent to the male species, that men are somehow born to fight. For starters, we no longer need such violence to survive; instead, what we need now is to "intimate," as he puts it. And in this, men have no belief system, because men are taught violence, but they are not taught intimacy. "Violence is a skill that we all had to learn just to stay with the pack growing up," he said. "The trouble is, it doesn't work for intimacy. That's a whole different set of skills." Read any news story today about domestic violence homicide and you're likely to see some version of the question why didn't she leave? What you almost surely won't see is why was he violent? Or better yet, why couldn't he stop his violence? Men, Sinclair believes, get one type of training and women get another. In a white paper he sent to me from a conference presentation some years ago, he paraphrased an assistant sheriff from San Francisco who told him, "men learn to be men by defining themselves as superior to each other and to women, and much of the violence in our communities is due to men's ongoing enforcement of this learned belief in their superiority, be it spousal abuse, gang turf wars, street assaults, armed robbery, and all the other crimes that men in the jails had been charged with. Men... had learned that it was normal to use force and violence in all of the forms above to enforce their social obligation to be superior."

Dalton rejected the rote memorization taught in most schools in the early twentieth century and instead advocated that students become their own teachers. Curriculum plans were individualized, and students were tasked with learning to study, learning to learn by themselves. In Sinclair's school, there were always a teacher to ask, to offer some guidance, and tutors were available, but the whole idea was to be an active participant in one's own educational formation. It is a philosophy that threads itself into his life and work still today. As I sat with him one night at a restaurant in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco and he told me about his life, it became clear that his career was made up of projects and that he had created the methodology for each project, whether it was documenting marches against the Vietnam War in New York City or diving into the River Thames to film protests against the nuclear submarines.

What is the worst thing to happen to someone you love? Anyone who's lived a life in which these three questions are immediately answerable may have some kind of understanding of what drives Jimmy today. In the first story he's a kid, maybe eight or nine years old. In the second, he's a young adult, midtwenties. In the third, he is all grown up.

It is a failure to understand these critical moments in context that makes the "Why didn't she leave?" question so maddening.<br>
Look at Michelle Monson Mosure. Look at any intimate partner homicide anywhere in any given year and it will be the same: she tried every which way she could. She tried and tried, but the equation, or rather, the question, isn't a matter of leaving or staying. It's a matter of living or dying.<br>
They stay because they choose to live.<br>
And they die anyway.<br>
Michelle Mosure stayed for her kids and for herself. She stayed for pride and she stayed for love and she stayed for fear and she stayed for cultural and social forces far beyond her control. And her staying to anyone trained enough to see the context, looked a lot less like staying and a lot more like someone tiptoeing her way toward freedom.

Michelle did not recant [her statement about her husband's domestic violence] because she was a coward, or because she believed she had overreacted, or because she believed she had overreacted, or because she believed Rocky [her husband] to be any less dangerous. She did not recant because she was crazy, or because she was a drama queen, or because any of this was anything less than a matter of life and death. She did not recant because she had lied. She recanted to stay alive. She recanted to keep her children alive.<br>
Victims stay because they know that any sudden move will provoke the bear.<br>
They stay because they have developed tools, over the years, that have sometimes worked to calm down an angry partner: pleading, begging, cajoling, promising, and public displays of solidarity, including against the very people--police, advocates, judges, lawyers, family--who might be the only ones capable of saving their lives.<br>
They stay because they see the bear coming for them. And they want to live.<br>
Why victims stay isn't the question we need to be asking. Rather, I think a better question is: how do we protect this person? No qualifiers. No musing about why she stayed or what she might appear to be doing or not doing. Just one simple question: how do we protect her?

Women like Michelle Monson Mosure share this steadfastness. A determination and resoluteness to keep themselves and their children alive by any means possible. They don't quit. They stay in abusive marriages because they understand something that most of us do not, something from the inside out, something that seems to defy logic: as dangerous as it is in their homes, it is almost always far more dangerous to leave. Many of them plan, like Michelle died. They stay. They bide their time. They keep their children safe. They balance, poised, on the front lines.

I asked her [the former White House liaison to the Office of Violence Against Women] if money was not an issue, if she could do whatever she wanted with whatever she needed, how would she solve domestic violence? She said she would take a community, study what worked, and then invest everywhere. "You can't look at one little piece of the system and say, 'Oh, that's the magic bullet.' That's what ... people want to do. If we could invest in one thing, what would it be? Well, the answer is, there's not one thing." And that's the whole point: private violence affects in some way nearly every aspect of modern life, yet our collective failure to treat it publicly demonstrates a stunning lack of understanding about this very pervasiveness.<br>
My goal for No Visible Bruises, then, is to shine a flashlight in the darkest corners, to show what domestic violence looks like from the inside out... Section one tries to answer that most dogged of questions: why victims stay. (Kit Gruelle told me once: "We don't say to bank presidents after a bank's been robbed, 'You need to move this bank.'") Michelle Monson Mosure's life and death shows us what we don't know we're seeing, that the question of leaving versus staying disregards the cavalcade of forces at work in an abusive relationship.<br>
Section two, perhaps the most difficult section to report, interrogates violence at its core, with abusers. Too often we've overlooked their important view by speaking only to victims, advocates, and police. In the current climate of toxic masculinity I wanted to know what such a man looked like, how he viewed himself in society and within his own family. Over and over I asked, during the years I was researching this book, whether a violent man could be taught to be nonviolent. The answers almost always fell along these lines: police officers and advocates said no, victims said they hoped so, and violent men said yes. This last response felt to me less like a theory and more like an expression of their willingness. The most common aphorism in the world of domestic violence is "hurt people hurt people." So if a hurt person took his own pain and grappled with it, rather than turning it outward toward the people in his life, how would that happen?<br>
In the third section I shadow the changemakers, people on the front lines of domestic violence and domestic violence homicide, like Suzanne Dubus, Kelly Dunne, and others. I look into what can be done, and who's doing it. Here I delve into advocacy, the judiciary and law enforcement initiatives to explore how they look from street level.

For many, Nicole Brown Simpson became the face of a new kind of victim. She was beautiful, wealthy, famous. If it could happen to her, it could happen to anyone. OJ's history of violence with her had been known to law enforcement. He'd been arrested, then bailed out, then sentenced to "telephone counseling" by a California judge (after which the case was dropped). Nicole's 911 tapes allowed listeners in to a rare scene: a woman under siege by a man who claimed to love her. The threats, the coercion, the terror, it was all right there. Her murder hurled into the forefront a conversation that advocates had been having for years--that it could happen anywhere, to anyone. How to reach victims who didn't reach out to them was one of their biggest problems in those days. But when local papers ran stories about Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, for the first time nearly all of them listed sidebars with where to go for help. Victims suddenly began to access resources in unprecedented numbers. Calls to domestic violence hotlines, shelters, and police skyrocketed in the wake of the trial. Domestic violence edged its way into the national conversation.

But we give victims the message to stay in other ways, too. When our court system puts them on the defensive, asks them to face a person who may have tried to kill them, a person they know only too well may kill them for real next time. We see it in court rulings that give violent perpetrators a mere slap on the wrist, a fine, maybe. A few days in jail after a brutal assault. We get the message when law enforcement treats domestic violence as a nuisance, a "domestic dispute," rather than the criminal act that it is. I have to believe if the tables were turned, if women were beating and killing men in such vast numbers--fifty women a month in the United States are killed by their intimate partners using guns alone--the problem would be the front page of every newspaper in this country. Vast pools of funding would surface for researchers to figure out what's wrong with women today.<br>
And, after all of this, we have the audacity to ask why victims stay.<br>
The reality is that many victims like Michelle Monson Mosure and her children are actively and stealthily trying to leave, working within the system that exists and step by step, with extreme vigilance, doing everything they can to escape. In so many cases, including hers, we mistake what we see from the outside as her choosing to stay with an abuser, when in fact it's we who don't recognize what a victim who is slowly and carefully leaving actually looks like.<br>
None of this is surprising, given that we didn't recognize domestic violence as wrong for most of human history. Jewish, Islamic, Christian, and Catholic religions all traditionally believed it was within a husband's purview to discipline his wife in more or less the same manner as he might discipline and control any other of his properties, including servants, slaves, and animals; of course, the holy texts--Koran, Bible, and Talmud--from which such beliefs stem were simply interpretations by (of course) men of the time. Some of these interpretations even gave instruction on the manner of wife beating, such as avoiding direct blows to the face, or making sure not to cause lasting injury... In the United States, the Puritans had laws against wife beating, though they were largely symbolic and rarely, if ever, enforced. Instead, abused wives were believed to have provoked the violence of their husbands--and this belief threads through hundreds of years of literature on deomestic violence, nearly everything written about spousal abuse, in fact, prior to the 1960s and 70s. On those very rare occasions when a case of private violence did make it to a courtroom, the rulings tended to side in favor of the man so long as the wife's injuries were no permanent.

She'd spent years with her abuser, and he used to hold her up naked to the heating pipes in their apartment or toss a blanket over her head and duct tape her around the neck. Her story of abuse and eventual freedom was among the most chilling stories I'd heard. Even now, writing this of her, I can include just these details because they don't identify her, and the particulars of her story--the heating pipes, the blanket--appear in so many others' stories, too.

Our homes and families are supposed to be sacred territory, the "haven in a heartless world," as my college sociology teacher drilled into me... This is part of what makes it so untenable. It's violence from someone you know, from someone who claims to love you.<br>
... We live in a culture in which we are told our children must have a father, that a relationship is the ultimate goal, that family is the bedrock of society, that it's better to stay and work out one's "issues" in private than to leave and raise kids as a single mother. Michelle Monson Mosure said this over and over when she insisted to her mother that she didn't want to raise her children in a "broken home." As if a home with one adult abusing another adult isn't broken, as if there are degrees of brokenness. The messages are insidious and they are consistent.

[Domestic violence] is a direct cause of homelessness for more than half our homeless women and is overall the third leading cause of homelessness in our country. The overwhelming majority of incarcerated men today first witnessed or experienced violence as children in their own homes, and children who grow up in violent homes are at far greater risk for developmental disorders. And those mass shootings that seem to plague us more with each new year?<br>
Most of them, too, are domestic violence.<br>
...In other words, it's not that domestic violence predicts mass shootings. It' that mass shootings, more than half the time, are domestic violence.

Like many people who hold a casual acquaintance with a problem, I believed all the common assumptions: that if things were bad enough, victims would just leave. That restraining orders solved the problem (and that if a victim didn't show up to renew a restraining order, the problem had been solved). That going to a shelter was an adequate response for victims and their children. That violence inside the home was something private, unrelated to other forms of violence, perhaps most notably mass shootings. That a lack of visible injury signaled a lack of seriousness. And, perhaps most of all, that unless we stand at the receiving end of a punch, such violence had nothing at all to do with us.<br>

When my mother was dying, I prayed for the first time in my life, and the world returned something to me: a vibrational awakening, a gift of energy that loosened the snake grip of pain and, blessedly, also shook me out of the numbing anger settling in my brain. Later I read Virginia Woolf's aborted memoir, Moments of Being, and was drawn to a passage recalling the paralyzing shocks that sent her into a depression, and how her experience of imperilment and recuperation through writing led her to conclude that there is an order behind our existence:<br>
"From this I reach what I might call a philosophy; at any rate it is a constant idea of mine; that behind the cotton wool is hidden a pattern; that we--I mean all human beings--are connected with this; that the whole world is a work of art; that we are parts of the work of art... Certainly and emphatically there is no God; we are the words; we are the music; we are the thing itself. And I see this when I have a shock... There is a pattern hid behind the cotton wool."

The spring after [my mom] died, my father sent me this passage, by a scholar of ancient Egypt:<br>
We usually think of time as a river, a river like the Nile, with strong, swift current bearing us further and further away from what we have been and towards the time when we will be not at all... But perhaps we should think of time as a deep, still pool rather than a fast-flowing river... Instead of looking back at time, we could look down into it... and now again different features of the past--different sights and sounds and voices and dreams--would rise to the surface: rise and subside, and the deepp pool would hold them all, so that nothing was lost and nothing ever went away.<br>
The passage consoles me. The idea of time as a pool brings an actual solace, conjuring up the peculiar fact that our brains so often make the past as vivid as the present, without our choosing. Our memory is our weather, and we are re-created by it every day.

People kept saying to me, "It gets better at a year, doesn't it?" Or, "I hear it gets better at a year." It did. It got "better" in that I could go for days without thinking too much about the fact that someone I still loved as dearly as I ever did was dead. But to expect grief to heal is to imagine that it is possible to stop loving, to reconcile yourself to the fact that the lost one is somewhere else. So heal isn't the right word. I love C.S. Lewis's metaphor: A loss is like an amputation. If the blood doesn't stop gushing soon after the operation, then you will die. To survive means, by definition, that the blood has stopped. But the amputation is still there.(Complicated grief, it seemed to me, was more like an amputation that wouldn't stop bleeding, threatening your very survival; I could understand why therapists have wanted to designate it as a psychiatric disorder in the DSM-V, though it made me nervous that more people would just think of grief as something that ought to be treated by doctors, rather than supported by everyone.)

Of course, I was skeptical of this train of thought. It struck me as a form of American "positive thinking" at its most embedded. Yet according to the researcher George Bonanno, the bereaved often take comfort in what is termed "benefit finding"--a tendency to focus on the so-called silver lining inside the dark cloud. Bonanno notes that people whose loved ones die painfully from cancer often say later, "I am just thankful I had the chance at least to say goodbye."

"The Perseid meteor showers are here," [my dad] told me. "And I've been eating dinner outside and then lying in the lounge chairs watching the stars like your mother and I used to"--at some point he stopped calling her Mom--"and that helps. It might sound strange, but I was sitting there, looking up at the sky, and I thought, 'You are but a mote of dust. And your troubles and travails are just a mote of a more of dust.' And it helped me. I have allowed myself to think about things I had been scared to think about and feel. And it allowed me to be there--to be present. Whatever my life is, whatever my loss is, it's small in the face of all that existence... A few months ago a night like this would make me feel bad the next day; it was so obvious your mother wasn't there. But not this time. The meteor shower changed something. I was looking the other way through a telescope before: I was just looking at what was not there. Now I look at what is there."

The ancients are right: the dear old human experience is a singular, difficult, shadowed, brilliant experience that does not resolve into being comfortable in the world. The valley of the shadow is part of that, and you are depriving yourself if you do not experience what humankind has experienced, including doubt and sorrow. We experience pain and difficulty as failure instead of saying, I will pass through this, everyone I have ever admired has passed through this, music has come out of it, literature has come out of it. We should think of our humanity as a privilege.

As George A. Bonanno, a clinical psychologist at Columbia University, has written, "When we look more closely at the motional experiences of bereaved people over time, the level of fluctuation is nothing short of speculation." This oscilliation, he theorizes, offers relief from the stress grief creates. That made sense. I thought of one of the lines from [C.S.] Lewis's A Grief Observed: "Sorrow ... turns out to be not a state but a process," he wrote. "It needs not a map but a history."

Then we fought, my father and I; it was snowing, my mother was in the hospital, I came home, I was tired, I had to teach, I took my mother's car. You can't take that, said my father, and I told him I wasn't a child anymore. When people are hurting they cannot always comfort one another; it was true of us. We had the same injury and different symptoms. We were on the landing; my brothers emerged from their rooms to calm us down, but we couldn't be calmed. If I'm going to help you I have to be helped in return, I said to my father, I need to borrow the car. Don't blackmail me, he said, I can't believe you would blackmail me at a time like this. Of course I was not blackmailing him but he was the bleeding front of a war, a war that was going badly, and all its resources were here, bleeding out, being badly used. I'll worry about you, and I can't have that, he said. You don't get to decide, not just because I'm thirty-two years old, but because to live is to worry, to wonder when the last hour comes, as it one day will. I thought of us fishing together in the past that was now always past except when we remembered it, him showing me how to thread the line, all the hours still to be used before both of us, the sun shining more shimmeringly in memory than it ever could now. But I was bereft and that made me cold and I had no sympathy for him, I was just alight with anger.<br>
Now I think it was cowardly of me--so cowardly--not to have paused to imagine how terrifed he was. But to get through the awful days I had to be persuaded of the absolute reality of the tunnel I crawled through. Otherwise I might have merely fallen to the ground in despair.

That night she seemed more herself than in weeks, joking with Isabel and Diana on the phone. Her locutions were slightly off, but poetically. When Diana asked how she felt, my mother responded, "I hurt less." It was a windy night, and we sat and watched--as it happened--a particularly stormy episode of Lost. A gust of wind howled outside.

We talked briefly about [Kel's] mother and he revealed the nature of her last few years and of her death, which I had suspected, but it was very sad to hear it confirmed. He asked me only one question and i was able to answer it in a way that seemed to please him. When we hung up i went to take his picture off my shelf--I feared that he would think it strange for me to have--but then I changed my mind. Charlene sent it for a reason.<br>
I have had several bouts of nervousness thinking about his first sight of me. I wish I could be obscured by something when he first sees me, hiding behind a plant or a sofa. I wish I could be shadowed by something larger than I am. But I can't be, so instead I will throw open both doors as wide as I can, and I will stand there in full sight of him, and I will welcome him into my home.<br>
For an hour, while Yolanda was napping, I sat in my chair, looking around ths room, pondering the life of Charlene Keller since I had last seen her, and how it could have been different--how my life too could have been different. Both of us stuck in our homes, curled into ourselves in loneliness. Both of us alone. It could have been different, I thought. Quite different. I did not linger there.<br>
Instead I walked to my front door and opened it. I peered out into the world. The street was quiet and nothing moved. I opened the glass outer door and walked out onto the stoop. A car rolled by, looking for parking, and for a moment I grew nervous and excited but it was not the boy. I stood very still then and put my arms about myself.<br>
O what will happen now, I asked. But I was alone, and I found I could not answer.

When [my mom] first died i thought to myself, I could have prevented it. And this was the most painful thing to think. She wasn't hit by a train. It wasn't a clean even death like that. I could have stopped her. I could have reasoned. At first when I thought of these things I would shut my brain off, just as I do before games. I would stop myself from thinking anything at all.<br>
But today it seems possible--just possible--to think about her in all her states, drunk and sober, tidy or messy or anything. The times she was a good mother, because they existed, they did exist, and the times she was very bad.

I guess i could keep trying. I still have the spring ahead of me. Maybe I'll play better than I ever have, and maybe some other scout, some other recruiter, will notice me. Maybe. All of these are maybes. And then i think about the Marcus Hobarts of the world, the people who play like they are magic, the people who play like they were made for baseball and baseball was made for them. Sometimes I think that I am like this too, like I am part of this, but there are days, more and more, when I'm not sure. And I think you have to be sure. I think the Marcus Hobarts of the world are positive.<br>
So I've been thinking about Mr. Warren said [about going to college instead of the MLB after graduating high school], which I kind of can't believe. It isn't too late. It's not like I don't have college coaches still interested in me. I talked to Lindsay's dad about it and he said, I think that's a really good idea, Kel.<br>
Of course he did.<br>
But really I'm considering it. Now that my mother's gone--I guess I can do whatever I want. This is a thought that makes me feel happy and sad all at once. It is what I spent two years wondering about: how I would ever leave her, how I could possibly hope to have a life outside of Yonkers or Pells. Now I can go to school wherever I want.

I feel like people are only really dead once you stop learning about them. This is why it is important to me to keep learning about my mother, and what she wanted, and what her life meant, what she meant by the life she led. Then she will be alive, somehow, and her wish for me will have come true. My vow is to learn more about her. To see her as she saw herself.<br>
So I like that Arthur Opp knew my mother the way he did. That he had a connection to her, outside of me. I like that she had a secret. I like that she had some little thing to think about, someone separate from me and my life. I wonder if she was in love with him. I can see her being in love with him, from the letters of his that I have read. She always had heroes, from the time I was little: I was the main one, the great hero of her life, but there was Dr. Greene, and the rich people from Pells, and my coaches, and my teachers. She liked hearing about them from me. She would have loved the Harpers. She liked smart people. She wanted me to be smart.<br>
I am not mad at her for lying. I think she did it so I would be sure to meet him. I can see her doing that. I can see her giving us to each other as a gift.

Then I put the latest letter from Arthur Opp on the top of the pile, and thought of taking it into another room to open it, but i did not want to be like my mother, so instead I tore open the envelope right there in front of Lindsay, but I didn't take out the note inside it.<br>

What do you think, said Lindsay.<br>
I don't know, I said.<br>
If you had to guess, said Lindsay.<br>
But I didn't want to guess anymore.<br>
Together we read his letter. We read it seven times. He was not my father. I wasn't crushed. I felt no badness or anger. I was not sure what I had wanted. He sounded like a teacher in his letter. I liked him. I tried to picture him and couldn't, so I pictured someone backlit by the sun. He could be anyone. Anyone except my father, according to him. All of my life I thought this about my father: that he could be anyone I passed on the street. On the street I looked for my father in every man I saw. I looked for him in my sleep. Now I know there are two less people my father could be. Two less for me to wonder about. The rest of the world remains.<br>

Last night, a thought occurred to me that i had never had before, and the thought was of Arthur Opp's letters to my mother. All of the letters he sent to our house. At times they were separated by weeks or months, but they always came, and my mother always brightened and smiled and took them into her bedroom to read. He was a sort of magic in her life, and in a way he was magic for me too--the mysterious Arthur Opp, who in my childish dreams was a rich benefactor who would one day appear and marry her.

My task then was to write back to the boy.<br>
I am deeply sorry to hear about your mother's death. i knew her when she was about twenty years old. We had a special sort of friendship, but I regret to tell you that, although you do have a father--everyone does--he is not I. I wish with all of my heart that I could tell you differently. I hope this doesn't bring you any sort of despair. Fathers aren't all they are cracked up to be. For example I know who my father is, but I also know he isn't a very good one, and I probably would have been better off without him. All my life I have heard it said that you can't choose your family, and all my life I have lamented this fact as true and unfair. But I think it is possible to look at things differently: I believe we can choose to surround ourselves with a circle of people we love and admire and they can become our adopted family. For example I had an adoped sister for many years. Her name was Marty. And I seem to have found a daughter to adopt along the way as well, and her name is Yolanda, and I hope you will meet her someday.<br>
And then I invited him to my dinner party, and told him about all the letters I'd had from his mother over the years, and that maybe I could tell him about his mother when she was young, and I encouraged him to bring whomever he pleased.<br>
...I imagined, one day, telling the boy the story of our name [Arthur]. My mother used to tell me it was a name for kings. When I was growing up this embarrassed me because I thought of myself as very far from kingly. But looking at his picture--Arthur, who was named for me--I reconsidered. Maybe all along it suited me, if only so it could be given to him.

I hold the sealed envelope in my hands and look at it. I look at her.<br>
We can mail it now, says Lindsay. If you want.<br>
Very quietly we tiptoe out of the dim house. The only light in the entryway comes from the tree. Outsside it is cold and still and I can see every star. Lindsay lets me drive her car, and we both try not to slam the doors. At the Pells Landing Post Office I leave the car running and get out and walk up to the mail slot on the side of the building and drop it in. I close my eyes for a minute. Just a minute.<br>
When I get back in Lindsay has turned on the radio and I smile at her for the first time in what seems like years. And I feel like a kid for the first time in years.<br>
Do you mind if we go someplace? I ask her.<br>
Where?<br>
Do you mind?<br>
No.<br>
So I drive up the Hudson to the beach I know, and there are little lights on the dry-docked boats, and a train whistles by in the distance. This is where I came the night I kissed you, I said. After Margo broke my taillight.<br>
Why did you come here? she asks me.<br>
I wanted to think about you some more, I say.<br>
And I was avoiding my mother, I say, but I laugh, it's a joke.<br>
We talk for a very long time and I ask her if it gets easier and she says not really, just different, a different duller kind of hurt, the kind that doesn't surprise you anymore. I ask what her parents were like when it happened and she says they have never been the same. We fought all the time for two years after it happened, she says. But not so much anymore.<br>
...I dream of many things, among them the old man who helped me and my mother get to the World Series, the old man from Pennsylvania who, years ago, paid for our car to be towed. I think of him when I need relief, when I need to feel that the world is not after all very bad. In my dream he is driving in his truck with my mother beside him. They are singing along to the radio. They're smiling. I am there and not there. I am outside and they are in.

Stop, says Lindsay. Stop thinking what you're thinking.<br>
We lie down so she's at a right angle to me on the curved sectional couch. Our heads are touching. I kissed her down here.<br>
We're silent for a while. I wait for Lindsay to talk. She is like this: quiet, quiet, until she builds up the courage to say what it is she has to say.<br>
...I dig in my back pocket for my wallet and take out [my mom's] good-bye note to me. I hand it to Lindsay. It is the most trust I've ever put in anyone.<br>
...I'm gonna mail it to him[Arthur], I say.<br>
The whole note? says Lindsay.<br>
The whole note, I say.<br>
You don't want to keep it? says Lindsay.<br>
No, I say.<br>
In fact I want to get rid of it very badly. As soon as I can. The week after she died, I read it all the time because I missed her. But after a while I got sick of it, sick of regretting, sick of remembering it all. Finding her. Calling the goddamn ambulance. Sitting in the goddamn hospital. I want to drop it in the mailbox and be done with it. It seems easier to me than calling him and explaining the whole situation. It seems right.

While I'm waiting I tell myself that maybe [the baseball tryout] wasn't so bad. That maybe they need us both. We play different positions, I tell myself. Maybe it's fine. But in my heart I know. I know it's not good enough. What I did, how I played. I know it's not nearly good enough for the majors.<br>
When Lindsay picks me up I think she knows before I get in the car.<br>
Hi, she says. She doesn't ask questions. This is why I like her: Because she is an athlete. Because she understands.<br>
Do you want to come over for the afternoon? she asks.<br>
OK, I say.<br>
And I sink into the seat of her father's Lexus, smooth inside, leathery and soft, a whisper of a car. Comforting in ways it shouldn't be.<br>
My mother drew the bull's-eye. She propped the mattress up and drew the red bull's-eye on it for me. My mother, wearing sweatpants and a robe, her feet bare in our grassless backyard, and there I was behind her, tossing a baseball into the air. And catching it. Oh I caught it. Oh I always did.

On the pitcher's mound, Marcus tosses the ball up in the air and catches it.<br>
How many hours have I spent in my life doing that. Just doing that with any type of ball I could find. Baseballs and basketballs and footballs. Rocks when there were none. Marbles. Pennies. Flipping quarters. Throwing books in the air and catching them. Just tossing things. I think it is what I have done most in my life. Lying down on my bed or standing up or out in the little backyard or on the street or on the way to or from school or in practice or at recess or on the neighborhood court. The clean release of a sphere into space. The muscle behind it. The force from your legs, from your gut, from your back, from your shoulders and biceps and elbows--the sling of the elbow, the catapult--and then the flicking wrist, and then the loving palm, and then goodbye, goodbye. The dance off the fingertips and into the air. The skipping spin. The last loving touch and then it's gone, gone, and you know when you've done it right and when you've done it wrong. There is certainty and there is justice in it. You know when you say goodbye to it with your skin. Whether it will go right or left, too high, too low, you know. You know. You know.<br>
I swing. I miss. I wait. A strike. A ground ball. A strike. It's not terrible--I take a piece out of a lot of them, and I hit one more home run--but I'm not here. I fail. I don't hit my stride and I can't get used to Marcus's pitching. He is better than I am. I know it to be true. A better player. More deserving. Once I allow myself to have this thought I can't shake it. I can't unthink it. I want to feel sorry for myself, but I almost feel relieved.<br>
The last thing we do is a sixty-yard dash. Mr. Kane gives us a while to warm up. I run a lap around the bases while they measure the distance and set up cones. Normally I can do it in 7.1. That was always been my speed. But I know, today, that 7.1 won't be impressive, that I must dig into all of my reserves and come up with something better than that. So when I run it I tell myself that I am on fire, that I am running from a murderer. I used to run up the stairs to my room as quick as I could when I was little because I always imagined a bad guy running up them after me. So I picture this. And when I'm done, Gerard Kane looks at his watch and says, Seven flat.<br>
But Marcus Hobart runs it in 6.93. I should be faster than him. He pitches. I should have been faster.

"I'm invisible," [Charlene] said to me. "I'm really invisible." A very fat tear rolled down her cheek, the saddest tear I've ever seen, and I had and resisted the urge to rouch it.<br>
What do you mean, I asked her. But she shook her head and she would say no more. Instead she talked about school and work and how she planned on balancing the two, and how she had never been happier than she was now in her life, coming to school in the city, starting her life in the world. It was what she called it. Making her life in the world. I knew what she meant.<br>
She stood up shakily at the end of the meal and raised one finger in the air as if testing the wind and she pointed it at me smiling.<br>
I have always loved aggrieved and unbeautiful women. I have always loved beautiful women too, but it is the unbeautiful ones that haunt me and find me and abide, whose images I see before me when I go to sleep. My mother was unbeautiful. Charlene was unbeautiful. Marty.<br>
None were invisible to me. Furthermore I don't believe I was invisible to them, and this has remained, for me, an anchor in the world. Charlene, in her letters to me, told me things about myself I had never been told before. She made me feel noble and worthy. She told me once that I was a hero of hers. For years, our correspondence allowed me to feel connected, still, to Charlene Turner. Even after she stopped responding. Even then. I thought of her, and remembered her fondly, feeding the ducks, sipping her drink, walking swiftly wherever she had to go. I thought of her and I felt she was surely also a member of my club. And so i did not blame her for losing touch. I really didn't blame her at all.<br>
When, years later, she called me, it was a surprise but I realized that I had been expecting it all along. My innermost self had been expecting it.<br>
She said to me, he'll call you. And so I began to hope. I did not hesitate to. I did the foolish thing of imagining a life with Charlene and her son. This led me to Yolanda. And Yolanda broke my spell of solitude. I feel somehow, I can't explain it, that my diminishing loneliness caused Charlene's to increase. I have felt, always, that we are connected by that thread.<br>
She named her son Arthur. It breaks my heart. It touches me deeply and yet I feel that some chance has been wasted.

Before [Charlene] called me this fall, before Yolanda came to me, in the ten years I spent with myself and no one else, I had ways of consoling myself. Yes there was food, but there was beyond food this idea I had of an oversoul of loneliness. A connectedness among the world's lonely that I could turn to when I was very low. There was a delicious romance in being utterly alone, and I told myself I was nobler for it, and that there was a purpose to my solitude, O there must be.<br>
I would pray. I no longer pray as much, now that Yolanda is here. I would pray first thing in the morning and last thing at night. I would remind myself of how many people there were like me, and how many people fall into the despair of loneliness, every day it happens, I would say, every day someone loses his connection to the world and then becomes the noble hermit, becomes connected to himself, the snake eating its tail, and then he must look steadily toward the lonely oversoul for help, he must or he will die. And then he becomes like I am, and the oversoul grows and expands lovingly, generously, and welcomes him as a member of its secret club. All of the people in the world who are lonely or sick or very sad.<br>
Before everything... while I waas still teaching, and even before. When I was a child. When I was unborn. I felt destined for solitude, very certain that one day it would find me, so when it did I was not surprised and even welcomed it.<br>
Throughout my life I have met only one person with whom I felt a certain kinship in this regard, and it was Charlene Turner. From the moment I met her I thought--you too? And I could see by the look in her eyes that she also felt it. She was more lonely at the time than I, I could sense it, and it made me love her.

No, you don't have to, I said. I don't have to put one in for her.<br>
But in my heart I felt she had spend her life not being noticed. So I wanted to tell someone--I wanted strangers to read it and to think, She was too young--and to shake their heads. And to say her name in their heads.<br>

I teach creative writing too so what I always say to my students is that books or short stories that write "to theme" are usually unsuccessful. So if you start out to write something about religion or like about coming of age, typically, in my experience, that results in sort of like cardboard feeling. More like a fable than a work of literature. Well fables are literature too, but more like a morality tale I guess is the way I would put it... I think I'll say, I was not setting out to write about either religion or divinity, which is a nice word you used, or immortality, but those are definitely themes that emerged. After I had finished writing the book, I was able to look back at it and say those are things, that's what this book is actually about. And yes I think the question of what happens to ours souls or ourselves after we die is very much part of this book, even though I didn't set out to write a book about that.

I do not mean to be sentimental about suffering--enough is certainly as good as a feast--but people who cannot suffer can never grow up, can never discover who they are. That man who is forced each day to snatch his manhood, his identity, out of the fire of human cruelty that rages to destroy it knows, if he survives his effort, and even if he does not survive it, something about himself and human life that no school on earth--and, indeed, no church--can teach. He achieves his own authority, and that is unshakable. This is because, in order to save his life, he is forced to look beneath appearances, to take nothing for granted, to hear the meaning behind the words. If one is continually surviving the worst that life can bring, one eventually ceases to be controlled by a fear of what life can bring; whatever it brings must be borne... it helps to expalin how [Negroes] have endured and how they have been able to produce children of kindergarten age who can walk through mobss to get to school... It demands great spiritual resilience not to hate the hater whose foot is on your neck, and an even greater miracle of perception and charity not to teach your child to hate.

It is for this reason that love is so desperately sought and so cunningly avoided. Love takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within. I use the word "love" here not merely in the personal sense but as a state of being, or a state of grace--not in the infantile American sense of being made happy but in the tough and universal sense of quest and daring and growth.

It seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of death--ought to decide, indeed, to earn one's death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life. One is responsible to life: It is the small beacon in that terrifying darkness from which we come and to which we shall return. One must negotiate this passage as nobly as possible, for the sake of those who are coming after us... It is the responsibility of free men to trust and to celebrate what is constant--birth, struggle, and death are constant, and so is love, though we may not always think so--and to apprehend the nature of change, to be able and willing to change. I speak of change not on the surface but in the depths--change in the sense of renewel. But renewel becomes impossible if one supposes things to be constant that are not--safety, for example, or money, or power.

Baldwin: I'm a writer. I like doing things alone... I love a few people and they love me and some of them are white, and isn't love more important than color?<br>
...The paradox--and a fearful paradox it is--is that the American Negro can have no future anywhere, on any continent, as long as he is unwilling to accept his past. To accept one's past--one's history--is not the same thing as drowning in it; it is learning how to use it. An invented past can never be used; it cracks and crumbles under the pressures of life like clay in a season of drought. How can the American Negro's past be used? The unprecedented price demanded--and at this embattled hour of the world's history--is the transcendence of the realities of color, of nations, and of altars.<br>
... The glorificatino of one race and the consequent debasement of another--or others--always has been and always will be a recipe for murder. There is no way around this... I am very much concerned that American Negroes achieve their freedom here in the United States. But I am also concerned for their dignity, for the health of their souls, and must oppose any attempt that Negroes may make to do to others what has been done to them. I think I know--we see it around us every day--the spiritual wasteland to which that road leads... Whoever debases others is debasing himself.

But what I did was my responsibility, and i would have to answer, too--unless, of course, there was also in Heaven a special dispensation for the benighted black, who was not to be judged in the same way as other human beings, or angels.

To defend oneself against a fear is simply to insure that one will, one day, be conquered by it; fears must be faced.<br>
...As I look back, everything I did seems curiously deliberate, though it certainly did not seem deliberate then.<br>
...I would have to give myself something to do, in order not to be too bored and find myself among all the wretched unsaved of the Avenue.

White people in this country will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and loe themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this--which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never--the Negro problem will no longer exists, for it will no longer be needed.<br>
...And yet, of course, at the same time, I was being spat on and defined and described and limited, and could have been polished off with no effort whatever. Every Negro boy--in my situation during those years, at least--who reaches this point realizes, at once, profoundly, because he wants to live, that he stands in great peril and must find, with speed, a "thing," a gimmick, to lift him out, to start him on his way. And it does not matter what the gimmick is.

From The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin<br>
The word "safety" brings us to the real meaning of the word "religious" as we use it. Therefore, to state it in another, more accurate way, I became, during my fourteenth year, for the first time in my life, afraid--afraid of the evil within me and afraid of the evil without. What I saw around me that summer in Harlem was what I had always seen; nothing had changed. But now, without any warning, the whores and pimps and racketeers on the Avenue had become a personal menace. It had not before occurred to me that I could become one of them, but now I realized that we had been produced by the same circumstances. Many of my comrades were clearly headed for the Avenue, and my father said that I was headed that way, too.

From The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin<br>
This innocent country set you down in a ghetto in which, in fact, it intended that you should perish. Let me spell out precisely what I mean by that, for the heart of the matter is here, and the root of my dispute with my country. You were born where you were born and faced the future that you faced because you are black and for no other reason. The limits of your ambition were, thus, expected to be set forever. You were born into a society which spelled out with brutal clarity, and in as many ways as possible, that you were a worthless human being. You were not expected to aspire to excellence: you were expected to make peace with mediocrity. Wherever you have turned, James, in your short time on his earth, you have been told where you could go and what you could do (and how you could do it) and where you could live and whom you could marry. I know your countrymen do not agree with me about this, and I hear them saying, "You exaggerate." They do not know Harlem, and I do. So do you. Take no one's word for anything, including mine--but trust your experience. Know whence you came. If you know whence you came, there is really no limit to where you can go. The details and symbols of your life have been deliberately constructed to make you believe what white people say about you. Please try to remember that what they believe, as well as what they do and cause you to endure, does not testify to your inferiority but their inhumanity and fear. Please try to be clear, dear James, through the storm which rages about your youthful head today, about the reality which lies behind the words acceptance and integration. There is no reason for you to try to become like white people and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that they must accept you. The really terrible thing, old buddy, is that you must accept them. And I mean that very seriously. You must accept them and accept them with love. For these innocent people have no other hope. They are, in effect, still trapped in a history which they do not understand; and until they understand it, they cannot be released from it. They have had to believe for many years, and for innumerable reasons, that black men are inferior to white men. Many of them, indeed, know better, but, as you will discover, people find it very difficult to act on what they know. To act is to be committed, and to be committed is to be in danger. In this case, the danger, in the minds of most white Americans, is the loss of their identity. Try to imagine how you would feel if you woke up one morning to find the sun shining and all the stars aflame. You would be frightened because it is out of the order of nature. Any upheaval in the universe is terrifying because it so profoundly attacks one's sense of one's own reality. Well, the black man has functioned in the white man's world as a fixed star, as an immovable pillar: and as he moves out of his place, heaven and earth are shaken to their foundations. You, don't be afraid. i said that it was intended that you should perish in the ghetto, perish by never being allowed to go behind the white man's definitions, by never being allowed to spell your proper name. You have, and many of us have, deafeated this intention; and, by a terrible law, a terrible paradox, those innocents who believed that your imprisonment made them safe are losing their grasp of reality. But these men are your brothers--your lost, younger brothers. And if the word integration means anything, this is what it means: that we, with love, shall force our brothers to see themselves as they are, to cease fleeing from reality and begin to change it. For this is your home, my friend, do not be driven from it; great men have done great things here, and will again, and we can make America what America must become. It will be hard, James, but you come from sturdy, peasant stock, men who picked cotton and dammed rivers and built railroads, and in the teeth of the most terrifying odds, achieved an unassailable and monumental dignity. you come from a long line of great poets, some of the greatest poets since Homer. One of them said, The very time I thought I was lost, My dungeon shook and my chains fell off.<br>
You know, and I know, that the country is celebrating one hundred years of freedom one hundred years too soon. We cannot be free until they are free. God bless you, James, and Godspeed. Your uncle, James.

You can only be destroyed by believing that you really are what the white world calls a nigger. I tell you this because I love you, and please don't you ever forget it.<br>
I have known both of you all your lives, have carried your Daddy in my arms and on my shoulders, kissed and spanked him and watched him learn to walk... if you've loved anybody that long, first as an infant, then as a child, then as a man, you gain a strange perspective on time and human pain and effort. Other people cannot see what I see whenever I look into your father's face, for behind your father's face as it is today are all those other faces which were his. Let me laugh and I see a cellar your father does not remember and a house he does not remember and I hear in his present laughter his laughter as a child. Let him curse and I remember him falling down the cellar steps, and howling, and I remember, with pain, his tears, which my hand or your grandmother's so easily wiped away... This is the crime of which I accuse my country and my countrymen, and for whiich neither I nor time nor history will ever forgive them, that they have destroyed and are destroying hundreds of thousands of lives and do not know it and do not want to know it. One can be, indeed one must strive to become, tough and philosophical concerning destruction and death, for this is what most of manking has been best at since we have heard of man. (But remember: most of mankind is not all of mankind.) But it is not permissible that the authors of devastation should also be innocent. It is the inocence which constitutes the crime.

Robin: When white parents say, "I've got to have the best school for my child." Why? Lets really look at why we think my child deserves the best of everything even knowing that that can only be if someone else doesn't have anything. That it depends on schools being unequal. I'm thinking of Toni Morrison... she says, "White people need black people to be the backdrop against we can rise." There is no superior without inferior. So it's a very deep relationship.

From On Being with Vincent Harding and Krista Tippett<br>
One of the drug running folks of the time said to me that he felt that one of the reasons why he had gone the way he had gone, not trying to excuse himself, was the fact that he and many other young people were operating in a situation where they felt it was very very dark. All around them. And what they needed, as he put it, were some sign posts, some lights that would, in other people's lives...live human sign posts that would help them see the possibilities for themselves. I've felt that one of the things we do badly in our educational process, especially working with marginalized young people, is that we educate them to figure out how quickly they can get out of the darkness and get into more pleasant situations, when what is needed again and again on more and more people who will stand in that darkness, who will not run away from those deeply hurt communities, and will open up possibilities that other people can't see any other way except seeing it through human beings who care about them. That is one of the stories I live with. I think human beings are meant to be sources of light for each other and if we teach young people to run away from the darkness rather than to open up the light in the darkness, to be the candles and the sign posts, then we are doing great harm to them and to the communities that they have come out of.

From On Being with Vincent Harding and Krista Tippett<br>
Stories aren't merely to pass on information, but also to engage in connection and community. I find that even in the strangest situations, I start by asking people tell a little of their story. And it is amazing what people discover of themselves, of their connections, of their community, and it's wonderful.<br>
Krista: To ask someone tell a little of their story is to give them a gift because we don't get asked that question and we do learn as much as we tell.

	<p id="1086">
From On Being with Vincent Harding and Krista Tippett<br>
The younger people themselves recognize how much we need to be connected to each other, to stay in community with one another, and as Martin Luther King Jr. said, to find out how we develop a community that is deeply committed to the best self of the others and go on from there.<br>
Krista:... people take the stories as tools and pieces of empowerment,<br>
Vincent: for their own best work... Ask the question: What are we for? ... Do we exist for some other reason besides competing with China or finding technological advances? Are there some things that are even deeper that we are meant for, meant to be, meant to do, meant to achieve. Jimmy Baldwin liked to talk about us achieving ourselves, finding who we are, what we are for, and making it possible for each other.
	</p>

	<p id="1085">
From On Being with Vincent Harding and Krista Tippett<br>
Stories is a way that humans beings have developed over the millenia. The story tellers bring the history of the experience, of the people, of the group, so that those who are new will know where they came from, and what their own possibilities and direction might be. There is something deeply built into us that needs story itself. Story is a source of nurture that we cannot become true human beings for ourselves and for each other without story. And to find ways to tell it, to share it, to create it, to encourage younger people to create their own story... We encourage the younger people to find the elders, to find the veterans, not the celebrities, not the tv stars, but the folks nobody else knows who have lived such magnificent lives. Find them, sit with them, and learn how to ask the right questions, so that the opening can take place. I think, this country cannot become its best self until we find ways more effectively of institutionalizing this process of sharing the stories of the elders.

Martin Luther King Jr. was very clear in his life that as he said for instance in the 60's... working among the poor there, he said very clearly, "I choose to identify with the poor. I choose to identify with the underprivelged. I choose to give my life to those who are left out of the sunlight of opportunity." And he saw this no simply in this country, but throughout the world. And that is part of the reason why he was clear that he had to speak to this country about the terribleness of what it was doing in Vietname because of the way it was affecting the poor in this country and the poor in that country.

James Baldwin and Malcolm couldn't understand how Martin Luter King Jr. could see those possibilities but I think Martin was seeing it because he was looking with an eye that was deeply filled by love and compassion and that eye opens us up to see many things that might otherwise be missed.<br>
Krista: [Vincent], you wrote: [Martin Luther] King [Jr] had a spirituality that makes it impossible for you to avoid the folks in trouble. Black folks were simply one of God's beloved people. King had to figure out what you do with all the other beloved people, especially the messed up beloved people that don't know they're beloved.<br>

For me, it opens up the question: what does it mean to be truly human? How are we meant to releate to each other in a way that builds our common humanity? Democracy is simply another way of speaking about that question. Religion is another way of speaking about that question. What is our purpose in this world and is that purpose related to our responsibilities to each other and to the world itself? All of that seems to me to be a variety of languages getting at the same reality.

It's not he didn't want me to be an excited person but I don't want to just like get so excited and think about what is all possible without getting too far ahead of myself.

If I had to give one piece of advice, it is that the key to beauty is the inside job. The key to beauty is feeling beautiful and no amount of money or makeup can really compensate for loving yourself. And so make sure that you do that. That is the one foundation of everything. And if you need a little boost or if you're feeling particularly challenged that day, look in the mirror and say, "I'm the bomb and I will make the world a better place in my little pocket, because that's what I'm here to do." You are a blessing to the world. Your talents are a blessing to the world. No matter who you are, there is something that you bring and you need to know that. And that is the best beauty secret of them all. Alright, I got my blazer on and I'm ready to seize the day. Make sure that you kiss someone that you love. That they give you a little love and that you're ready to go.

Brahman: Come now, take my hand. Let me show you what will happen. Come!<br>
And so Buddha passed away. Those disciples who were by his side started to weep. Some writhed in grief, while others stretched their arms towards heaven, lamenting his passing. More than 2000 years later, Buddhism has spread across the world, touching the hearts of people in China, Japan, various other pats of Asia, as well as Europe and America. That's because it teaches "How people ought to live": The foundation of love for one's fellows. 483 B.C... that's the year Gautama Buddha is said to have died. Buddha will always be following the outcome of that teaching, from somewhere in nature's grand bosom.

From Buddha Manga by Osamu Tezuka<br>
Buddha taught thousands of people, rich and poor alike, the path to enlightenment. Still, Buddha had yet to find true fulfillment. Something is missing. What are living things? What is life? Why do we live? Why do we die? As one grows old and dies, another is born, and so takes his place. This succession of life and death is necessary. Death guarantees that life will continue. Death is a necessary part of life... It's nothing to be sad about. Everyone must die. I'm no different. Death is inevitable... A few days ago, this [cocoon] was a caterpillar. In a few more days, a butterfly will crawl out of this cocoon and fly away. All life is like this butterfly's. Humans think they live for a long time. But in reality, our lives span a very short amount of time. Think of death as simply the time when our soul crawls out of our cocoon--our body-- and flies away.<br>
Ananda: But what happens to the soul after it flies away?<br>
Buddha: Does a pupa know what will happen to it when it leaves its cocoon? Likewise, we do not know what life we will lead after we shed our cocoons and depart. But I'm sure the next world is less restricting, more open than the world we know while we're alive... And that's why there's no reason to fear death. It's just the moment in which we pass from this world to the next.<br>
Ananda: But there's only one Buddha in the world! If you die, then no one will ever hear your sermons again!<br>
Buddha: Dogs and cats teach their young, just like parents teach their children what they learned through experience. I've passed on my knowledge to many during my life. And you'll take what you have learned and pass it on to younger disciples. That way my teachings will live on.

From Buddha Manga by Osamu Tezuka<br>
Buddha: I always tell you, each and every living thing in this world is deeply tied to everything else... not just humans, but dogs and horses and cows, tigers and fish and fowl... even bugs... even trees and grass. Everything is connected. The source of all life connects us. We are all siblings, equal. Please remember this. And remember that the trials and tribulations of life are part of the experience of sentient beings. If a parent or brother of yours is dying of hunger or suffers misfortune, what next? Your house meets ruin and you, too, will soon suffer. It is narrow-minded to want to cure your own pain only. You must think about your family, about others. It does not matter who or what, human or beast. Help the other. If it suffers, save it. If it is in trouble, help it. Why? Because all living creatures are kin in the house of nature! At times, you might sacrifice yourself to save others... The rabbit sacrificed itself to save the starving old man, and became a god... But I've also known a man who committed this deep in truth. He fed himself alive to a family of starving wolves, and so died. He must have suffered terribly, as he was torn apart... But each of you can do what you can. If you are rich, you can give to those who suffer. If you are strong, you can support those who suffer. If you are neither rich nor strong, you can listen to them and offer your sympathy, telling them you are sorry. That is good enough... you will have suffered for another. Let us call this spirit "mercy." It resides in every human soul.

Buddha: One day, as I was finishing my meal, I was thinking of just throwing out the leftovers when suddenly two of my disciples walked by. They had just returned from begging for food. However, they didn't have the best of luck, and both were still very hungry. There are some leftovers here. If you'd like, please take them. One monk said that it would be rude to turn his nose up at something that I had offered him. The other monk said: I appreciate the offer. However I came here to listen to you preach. I would never think of taking anything from you. Even though he looked like he would collapse from hunger, he just walked away. Which monk made the correct choice? What I have been trying to teach you all is how to live. For that purpose I've journeyed, and will journey, all my life. And you wish to receive something else from me? Do you follow me because you want to be fed? When a student graduates, he is no longer able to see his teacher every day. But the lessons he learned will remain. I will die someday, but I will leave my teachings to you. You'll each have to live on your own. Relying on your own selves.

Buddha: Do you believe in everything your father says? Do you really follow every command that he gives?... If you don't believe a command, whether it came from king or brahmin, you need not obey... You should trust your own heart and go proudly like an elephant. That is the best example to set for your children.

Not a day went by that I wasn't worried to death. But now, I don't have any money, so i don't have a care in the world. I'm happy all the time now.

Man: Humans and bugs are different. A human corpse is... well, much scarier, I dare say.<br>
Buddha: Isn't that all in your head? Both bugs and humans die. Both also live. Every living thing in this world is the same. It is born; it lives; it dies. Traveler, you don't fear corpses. What you fear is death. Yet all that is born must die... there's no point in fearing the inevitable...You worry about your assets. You worry about your fortune. You worry about everything, and so you fear death... Let go of worry; You'll find ease. You'll be happy until your dying day.

Two things are true. They are apparently contradictory but that's writing for you. On the one hand, you musn't think of your readers when you write because which reader? You can't do it. You have to write for yourself. Otherwise you get into a tears, a maelstrom of self correction and angst... this might please liberal New York but the midplane Christians are gonna hate it etc. etc. You have to get rid of all of that. On the other hand, you have to consider your reader insofar as there are anthropoligical limits on reading... And both of those statements are true.

I'm here just because I've written something. I suppose I'm a writer then. I hadn't given up the day job at that point but it's a process. You begin to sort of get little glimmerings of the idea that you are a writer and they become stronger and brighter and then there's more of the idea that you are a writer than there is the idea that you're not a writer and then eventually all those faces go and perhaps a few years later you've given up the day job and this is how you earn your living and what else you gonna call yourself?

From Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell<br>
Adam Ewing: Scholars discern motions in history and formulate these motions into rules that govern the rises and falls of civilizations. My belief runs contrary, however. To wit: history admits no rules; only outcomes.<br>
What precipitates outcomes? Vicious acts and virtuous acts.<br>
What precipitates acts? Belief.<br>
Belief is both prize and battlefield, within the mind and in the mind's mirror, the world. If we believe humanity is a ladder of tribes, a colosseum of confrontation, exploitation and bestiality, such a humanity is surely brought into being, and history's Horroxes, Boerhaaves and Gooses shall prevail. You and I, the moneyed, the privileged, the fortunate, shall not fare so badly in this world, provided our lucky holds. What of it if our consciences itch? Why undermine the dominance of our race, our gunships, our heritage and our legacy? Why fight the "natural" (oh, weaselly word!) order of things?<br>
Why? Because of this:--one find day, a purely predatory world shall consume itself. Yes, the Devil shall take the hindmost until the foremost is the hindmost. In an individual, selfishness uglifies the soul; for the human species, selfishness is extinction.<br>
Is this the doom written within our nature?<br>
If we believe that humanity may transcend tooth and claw, if we believe divers races and creeds can share this world as peaceably as the orphans share their candlenut tree, if we believe leaders must be just, violence muzzled, power accountalbe and the riches of the Earth and its Oceans shared equitably, such a world will come to pass. I am not deceived. It is the hardest of worlds to make real. Torturous advances won over generations can be lost by a single stroke of a myopic president's pen or a vainglorious general's sword.<br>
A life spent shaping a world I want Jackson[my son] to inherit, not one I fear Jackson shall inherit, this strikes me as a life worth the living. Upon my return to San Francisco, I shall pledge myself to the Abolitionist cause, because I owe my life to a self-freed slave and because I must begin somewhere.<br>
I hear my father-in-law's response: "Oho, fine, Whiggish sentiments, Adam. But don't tell me about justice! Ride to Tennessee on an ass and convince the rednecks that they are merely white-washed negroes and their negroes are black-washed Whites! Sail to the Old World, tell 'em their imperial slaves' rights are as inalienable as the Queen of Belgium's! Oh, you'll grow hoarse, a poor and gray in caucuses! You'll be spat on, shot at, lynched, pacified with medals, spurned by backwoodsmen! Crucified! Naive, dreaming Adam. He who would do battle with the many-headed hydra of human nature must pay a world of pain and his family must pay it along with him! And only as gasp your dying breath shall you understand, your life amounted to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean!"<br>
Yet what is an ocean but a multitude of drops?

Henry Goose: Our weaponry was not dropped onto our laps one morning. It is not manna from Sinai's skies. Since Agnicourt, the White man has refined and evolved the gunpowder sciences until our modern armies may field muskets by the tens of thousands! 'Aha!' you will ask, yes, 'But why us Aryans? Why not the Unipeds of Ur or the Mandrakes of Mauritius?' Because, Preacher, of all the world's races, our love--or rather our rapacity--for treasure, gold, spices and dominion, oh, most of all, sweet dominion, is the keenest, the hungriest, the most unscrupulous! This rapacity, yes, powers our Progress; for ends infernal or divine I know not. Nor do you know, sir. Sor do I overly care. I feel only gratitude with my Maker cast me on the winning side... Dearest Adam, I was practicing reserve, and more than a little! I longed to shout this at the old fool: --'Why tinker with the plain truth that we hurry the darker races to their graves in order to take their land and its riches? Wolves don't sit in their caves, concocting crapulous theories of race to justify devouring a flock of sheep! "Intellectual courage?" True "intellectual courage" is to dispense with these fig leaves and admit all peoples are predatory, but White predators, with our deadly duet of disease dust and firearms, are examplars of predacity par excellence, and what of it?<br>
Adam Ewing: It upsets me that a dedicated healer and gentle Christian can succumb to such cynicism. I asked to hear Goose's Second Law of Survival. Henry grinned in the dark and cleared his throat. "The second law of survival states that there is no second law. Eat or be eaten. That's it." He began snoring soon after, but my Worm kept me awake until the stars began weakening. Geckos fed and padded softly over my sheet.

Sonmi: To generate the show trial of the decade. To make every last pureblood in Nea So Copros mistrustful of every last fabricant. To manufacture downstrata consent for the Juche's new Fabricant Xpiry act. To discredit Abolitionism. You can see, the whole conspiracy has been a resounding success.<br>
Archivist: But if you knew about this...conspiracy, why did you cooperate with it? Why did you allow Hae-Joo Im to get so close to you?<br>
Sonmi: Why does any martyr cooperate with his judases?<br>
Archivist: Tell me.<br>
Sonmi: We see a game beyond the endgame. I refer to my Declarations, Archivist, Media has flooded Nea So Copros with my Catechisms. Every schoolchild in corpocracy knows my twelve "blasphemies" now. My guards tell me there is even talk of a statewide "Vigilance Day" against fabricants who show signs of the Declarations. My deas have been reproduced a billionfold.<br>
Archivist: But to what end? Some... future revolution? It can never succeed.<br>
Sonmi: As Seneca warned Nero: No matter how many of us you kill, you will never kill your successor. Now, my narrative is over. Switch off your silver orison. In two hours enforcers will escort me into the Litehouse. I claim my last request.<br>
Archivist: ...name it.<br>
Sonmi: Your sony and access codes.<br>
Archivist: What do you wish to download?<br>
Sonmi: A certain disney I once began, one nite long ago in another age. [Hinting at the film called the Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish.]

Archivist: Many xpert witnesses at your trial denied Declarations could be the work of a fabricant, ascended or otherwise, and maintained it was ghosted by Union or a pureblood Abolitionist.<br>
Sonmi: How lazily "xperts" dismiss what they fail to understand!...<br>
Archivist: And your capture came shortly after completing your text?<br>
Sonmi: The same afternoon. Once my function was fulfilled, there was no reason for Unanimity to let me run free. My arrest was dramatized for Media. I handed by Declarations on sony to Hae-Joo. We looked at each other for the last time; nothing is as eloquent as nothing. I knew we would never meet again, and maybe he knew that I knew.

Sonmi: The workers were bloodsoaked, from head to toe. I should properly call those workers butchers: they snipped off collars, stripped clothes, shaved follicles, peeled skin, offcut hands and legs, sliced off meat, spooned organs... drains hoovered the blood... The noise, you can imagine, Archivist, was deafening.<br>
Archivist: But... why would--What would the purpose be of such... carnage?<br>
Sonmi: The economics of corpocracy. The genomics industry demands huge quantities of liquefied biomatter, for wombtanks, but most of all, for Soap. What cheaper way to supply this protein than by recycling fabricants who have reached the end of their working lives? Additionally, leftover "reclaimed proteins" are used to produce Papa Song food products, eaten by consumers in the corp's dineries all over Nea So Copros. It is a perfect food cycle.<br>
Archivist: What you describe is beyond the... conceivable, Sonmi-451. Murdering fabricants to supply dineries with food and Soap...no. The charge is preposterous, no, it's unconscionable, no, it's blasphemy!... No such... "slaughtership" could possibly be permitted to xist. The Beloved Chairman would never permit it! The Juche would ionize Papa Song's entire xec strata in the Litehouse! If fabricants weren't paid for their labor in retirement communities, the whole pyramid would be... the foulest perfidy.<br>
Sonmi: Business is business.<br>
Archivist: You've described no "business" but... industrialized evil!<br>
Sonmi: You underestimate humanity's ability to bring such evil into being. Consider. You have seen the 3-Ds, but have you visited a fabricant retirement village, personally? I shall take your silence as a no. Do you know anyone who has visited one, personally? Again, no. Then where do fabricants go after retirement? Not just servers, the hundreds of thousands of fabricants who end their serviceable lives every year. There should be cities full of them by now. But where are these cities?<br>
Archivist: No crime of such magnitude could take root in Nea So Copros. Even fabricants have carefully defined rights, guaranteed by the Chairman!<br>
Sonmi: Rights are susceptible to subversion, as even granite is susceptible to erosion. My fifth Declaration posits how, in a cycle as old as tribalism, ignorance of the Other engenders fear; fear engenders hatred; hatred engenders violence; violence engenders further violence until the only "rights," the only law, are whatever is willed by the most powerful. In corpocracy, this means the Juche. What is willed by the Juche is the tidy xtermination of a fabricant underclass.<br>
Archivist: But what about the 3-Ds of Xultation and such? You saw them in the Papa Song's at Chongmyo Plaza yourself. There's your proof.<br>
Sonmi: Xhultation is a sony-generated simulacrum dijied in Neo Edo. It does not exist in the real Hawaii, or anywhere. Indeed, during my final weeks at Papa Song's, it seemed that scenes of Xultation repeated themselves. The same Hwa-Soon ran down the same sandy path to the same rock pool. My unascended sisters did not notice, and I doubted myself at the time, but now I had my xplanation.<br>
Archivist: Your Testimony must stand as you speak it, despite my protests. I--we must progress... How long did you watch this slaughter?<br>
Sonmi: I cannot recall, accurately. Perhaps ten minutes, perhaps an hour. I remember Hae-Joo leading me thru the dining area, numbly. Purebloods played cards, ate noodles, smoked, worked at sonys, joked, engaged in ordinary life. How could they know what happened in the underbelly and just... sit there, indifferent? As if it were not living fabricants being processed but pickled sardines? Why did their consciences not scream for this obscenity to end? The bearded security guard winked, saying, "Come back soon, honeysuckle."

From Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell<br>
Sonmi: I asked if Siddhartha was indeed a god.<br>
Many called him so, the Abbess agreed, but Siddhartha does not influence fortunate or weather or perform many of a divinity's traditional functions. Rather, Siddhartha is a dead man and a living ideal. The man taught about overcoming pain, and influencing one's future reincarnations. "But I pray to the ideal." She indicated the meditating giant. "Early, so he knows I'm serious."<br>
I said I hoped that Siddhartha would reincarnate me in her colony.<br>
Lite from the coming day defined the world more clearly now. The Abbess asked why I hoped so.<br>
It took a little time to form my answer. I said how all purebloods have a hunger, a dissatisfaction in their eyes, xcept for the colonists I had met.<br>
The Abbess nodded. If consumers found fulfillment at any meaningful level, she xtemporized, corpocracy would be finished. Thus, Media is keen to scorn colonies such as hers. comparing them to tapeworms; accusing them of stealing rainwater from WaterCorp; royalties from VegCorp patent holders, oxygen from AirCorp. The Abbess feared that, shold the day ever come when the Board decided they were a viable alternative to corpocratic idealogy, "the 'tapeworms' will be renamed 'terrorists,' smart bombs will rain, and our tunnels flood with fire."

Archivist: But... how could people there survive without franchises and gallerias? What did they eat? Drink? How about electricity? Entertainment? What about enforcers and order? How did they impose hierarchy?<br>
Sonmi: Go visit them, Archivist. You can tell the Abbess I sent you. No? Well, their food came from the forest and gardens, water from the cataract. Scavenge trips to landfills yielded plastics and metals for tools. Their "school" sony was powered by a water turbine. Solar nitelamps recharged during daylite hours. Their entertainment was themselves; consumers cannot xist without 3-D and AdV, but humans once did and still can. Enforcement? Problems arose, no doubt, even crises from time to time. But no crisis is insuperable if people cooperate.<br>
Archivist: What about the mountain winters?<br>
Sonmi: They survived as fifteen centuries of nuns had before them: by planning, thrift, and fortitude. The monastery was built over a cave, xtended by bandits during the Japanese annexation. These tunnels gave sufficient shelter from winter and Unanimity aeros. Oh, such a life is no bucolic Utopia. Yes, winters are severe; rainy seasons are relentless; crops fall prey to disease; their medicine is sorely limited. Few colonists live as long as upstrata consumers. They bicker, blame, and grieve as people will, but at least they do it in a community, and companionship is a fine medicine in itself. Nea So Copros has no communities now, only mutually suspicious substrata. I slept soundly that nite against a backdrop of gossip, music, complaints, and laughter, feeling safe for the first time since my dormroom in Papa Song's.

Sonmi: [Hae-Joo] said the giant was a deity that offered salvation from a meaningless cycle of birth and rebirth, and perhaps the cracked stonework still possessed a lingering divinity. Only the inanimate can be so alive. I suppose QuarryCorp will destroy him when they get around to processing those mountains.<br>
Archivist: Why did [Hae-Joo] Im take you on this field trip to the middle of nowhere?<br>
Sonmi: Every nowhere is somewhere, Archivist.<br>
Archivist: So Union hid its interlocutor, its... messiah, in a coloniy of recidivists?<br>
Sonmi: ... I was introduced to the Abbess as Ms. Yoo. one eye was milk-blind, her other brite and watchful. She clasped my hands in hers in a charming gesture. "You are welcome here," she tole me, "most welcome."

Archivist: How can any rational organization embrace a creed that opposes corpocracy? Not only is it terrorism but it would be suicide.<br>
Sonmi: All rising suns set, Archivist. Our corpocracy now smells of senility.<br>
Archivist: Well, you seem to have embraced Union propaganda wholeheartedly, Sonmi-451.<br>
Sonmi: And I might observe that you have embraced corpocracy propaganda wholeheartedly, Archivist.<br>
Archivist: Did your new friends mention xactly how Union plans to overthrow a state with a standing pureblood army of 2 million backed by a further 2 million fabricant troops?<br>
Sonmi: Yes. By engineering the simultaneous ascension of 6 million fabricants.<br>
Archivist: Fantasy. Lunacy.<br>
Sonmi: All revolutions are, until they happen, then they are historical inevitabilities.<br>
Archivist: How could Union possibly achieve this "simultaneous ascension"?<br>
Sonmi: The battlefield, you see, is neuromolecular. A few hundred Union-men in wombtank and Soap plants could trigger these vast numbers of ascensions by adding Suleiman's catalyst into key streams.<br>
Archivist: What damage could even 10 million --say--ascended fabricants inflict on the most stable state pyramid in the history of civilization?<br>
Sonmi: Who would work factory lines? Process sewage? Feed fish farms? Xtract oil and coal? Stoke reactors? Construct buildings? Serve in dineries? Xtinguish fires? Man the cordon? Fill exxon tanks? Lift, dig, pull, push? Sow, harvest? Now do you begin to see? Purebloods no longer possess these core skills upon which our corpocracy, or any society, rests. The real question is, what damage could 6 million ascensions not inflict, in combination with cordonlanders and downstrata purebloods such as those in Huamdonggil with nothing to lose?<br>
Archivist: Unanimity would maintain order. Enforcers aren't all Union agents.<br>
Sonmi: Even Yoona-939 chose death over slavery.<br>
...Archivist: Weren't you curious about Union's blueprint for the briter tomorrow? How could you know the new order would not give birth to a tyranny worse than the one it xpired? Think of the Bolshevik and Saudi Arabian Revolutions. Think of the disastrous Pentecostalist Coup of North America. Surely a program of incremental reforms, of cautious steps, is the wisest way to proceed?<br>
Sonmi: You show xtraordinary erudition for an eight-stratum, Archivist. I wonder if you encountered this dictum first spoken by a twentieth-century statesman: "An abyss cannot be crossed in two steps."

	<p id="1002">
From Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell<br>
Sonmi: Every conurb, my guide answered, has a chemical toilet, where the city's unwanted human waste disintegrates quietly, but not quite invisibly. It motivates the downstrata: "Work, spend, work," say slums like Huamdonggil, "or you, too, will end your life here." Moreover, entrepreneurs take advantage of the legal vaccuum to erect ghoulish pleasurezones for upstrata bored with more respectable quarters.<br>
... The Juche's rounds of new Enrichment Statutes are sticking band-aids on hemorrhages and amputations. Corpocracy's only strategy is that long favored by bankrupt ideologies: denial. Downstrata purebloods fall into untermensch sinks. Xecs merely watch, parroting Catechism Seven: "A Soul's value is the dollars therein."

From David Mitchell on Cloud Atlas<br>
It is a story of the human condition not in spite of ethnicity, nationality, sexual preference, etc, but because of them. I tried to put as much diversity through ethnicity, through time periods, gender, nationalities into the book as I could to show the universality of what is happening to the characters. It's not just one time place or location. This is a constant story that's being retold through time.<br>
...Well the human heart and the human mind don't change that much. The human heart probably doesn't change at all. Jealousy and checkof is the same as jealousy now and it'll be the same in 700 years in the future. Of course, what changes are the rules of the society, spoken and unspoken, written and unwritten, and the design, of what our clothes look like, how our human needs are met.

But we're digressing. Why had Hae-Joo Im chosen to show you this Ghastly Ordeal [of Timothy Cavendish]?<br>

Sonmi: ...It helped me understand how one's environment is a key to one's identity, but that my environment, Papa Song's, was a lost key. I found myself wishing to revisit my x-dinery under Chongmyo Plaza. I could not fully xplain why, but an impulse can be both vaguely understood and strong.<br>
Archivist: It could hardly be wise for an ascended server to visit a dinery?<br>
Sonmi: I do not claim it was wise, only necessary... Kyelim-889 cleared the table next to us; she had already forgotten me. My IQ may be higher, but she looked more content than I felt.<br>
Archivist: So your visit to Papa Song's was an... anticlimax? Did you find the "key" to your ascended self?<br>
Sonmi: Perhaps it was anticlimactic, yes. If there was a key, it was only that no key existed. In Papa Song's I had been a slave; at Taemosan I was a more privileged slave.

Archivist: And it was around this time that you grew aware of your own ascension?<br>
Sonmi: Correct. You wish me to describe the xperience? It mirrored Yoona-939's, I now recognize. Firstly, a voice spoke in my head. It alarmed me greatly, until I learned that no one else could hear this voice, known to purebloods as "sentience." Secondly, my language evolved: for example, if I meant to say good, my mouth substituted a finer-tuned word such as favorable, pleasing, or correct... Thirdly, my curiosity about all things grew acute: the "hunger" Yoona-939 had spoken of. I eavesdropped diners' sonys, AdV, Boardmen's speeches, anything, to learn. I, too, yearned to see where the elevator led... Amongst my sisters I alone understood our xistence's futility and drudgery... Ah, I envied my uncritical, unthinking sisters. But most of all, I was afraid.<br>
Archivist: How long did you have to endure that state?<br>
Sonmi: Some months... Time passed. Curiosity defeated my fear, finally, and I opened the dormroom door...<br>
Archivist: Rhee was dead? An overdose?<br>
Sonmi: ... Healthy fabricants, as you know, never wake during curfew. Bleak as the life of an ascending fabricant was, the prospect of reorientation was bleaker.<br>

Sonmi: A dinery server behaving like a pureblood attracts trouble; trouble attracts blame; blame demands a scapegoat...<br>
Archivist: When did Yoona-939 first attempt to make you complicit in her crime?<br>
Sonmi: I suppose the first time was when she xplained a newfound word, secret, one slow hour at the teller. The idea of knowing information no one else...knew...my teller-sister promised to show me what she could not xplain.<br>
...Between the elevator and the northeast hygiener, she told me to xamine the wall. I saw nothing. "Look again," Yoona urged, "look properly." This time I saw a speck, a tiny crack... Yoona took my hand; I hesitated... But my sister's will was stronger than mine. She pulled me through, shut the door behind us, and whispered, "Now, dear sister Sonmi, you are inside a secret."<br>
...What is that knife? I asked. "Only lite, from a flashlite," answered Yoona. I asked, Is lite alive? Yoona answered, "Perhaps lite is life, sister."<br>
...Catechism Three teaches that for servers to keep anything denies Papa Song's love for us and cheats His Investment. I wondered, did Yoona-939 still observe any Catechism?... Greatest of all, however, was a book, a picture book.

Archivist: A more metaphysical question... were you happy, back in those days?<br>
Sonmi: Before my ascension, you mean? If, by happiness, you mean the absence of adversity, I and all fabricants are the happiest stratum in corpocracy, as genomicists insist. However, if happiness means the conquest of adversity, or a sense of purpose, or the xercise of one's will to power, then of all Nea So Copros's slaves we surely are the most miserable. I endured drudgery but enjoy it no more than yourself.<br>

From Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell<br>
Sonmi: I became aware of Yoona-939's irregular speech. Firstly, she spoke more... Secondly, Yoona's speech grew more complex as the year aged. Orientation teaches us the lexicon we need for our work, but Soap erases xtra words we acquire later. So to our ears, Yoona's sentences were filled with noises devoid of meaning. She sounded, in a word, pureblood. Thirdly, Yoona took pleasure in humor... Humor is the ovum of dissent, and the Juche should fear it.

Archivist: "Comfort"? How do you mean?<br>
Sonmi: To enslave an individual troubles your consciences, Archivist, but to enslave a clone is no more troubling than owning the latest six-wheeler ford, ethically.

Sonmi: ...But it is true, we rarely wonder about life on the surface. Additionally, Soap contains amnesiads designed to deaden curiosity.

Behold your future, Cavendish the Younger. You will not apply for membership, but the tribe of the elderly will claim you. Your present will not keep pace with the world's. This slippage will stretch your skin, sag your skeleton, erode your hair and memory, make your skin turn opaque so your twitching organs and blue-cheese veins will be semivisible. You will venture out only in daylight, avoiding weekends and school holidays. Language, too, will leave you behind, betraying your tribal affiliations whenever you speak. On escalators, on trunk roads, in supermarket aisles, the living will overtake you, incessantly. Elegant women will not see you. Store detectives will not see you. Salespeople will not see you, unless they sell stair lifts or fraudulent insurance policies. Only babies, cats, and drug addicts will acknowledge your existence. So do not fritter away your days. Sooner than you fear, you will stand before a mirror in a care home, look at your body, and think, E.T. locked in a ruddy cupboard for a fortnight.

Janice(talking to Luisa Rey): When I was your age, I was alone in my house, coming downstairs from my daughter's nursery, and there on the halfway landing stood my mother. 'Go check the baby, Janice,' she said. I told my mother I'd checked her one minute ago, she was sleeping fine. My mother's voice turned to ice. 'Don't argue with me, young lady, go check the baby, now!' Sounds crazy, but only then I remembered my mother had died the Thanksgiving before. But I ran upstairs and found my daughter choking on the cord from the blind, wound around her neck. Thirty seconds, that would have been it. So you see? You see, honey?

Believe me, however, that I was never in the least danger of being ashamed of you. There was a time when I was disappointed at your failure to carry on the family tradition, but I have always been perfectly assured that you would not under any circumstances give me cause for shame... I trust that when we next meet we may learn to know each other rather better than we have done in the past.<br>

             Sure, alright.<br>

Annie walks around the car and starts to get into the front
passenger seat.<br>

                       RHODES
             Where you goin? You'll have to sit
             in the back seat. Yeah, it's
             against regulation for you to sit
             in the front.<br>

                        ANNIE
             What?!<br>

Rhodes opens the car's BACK door for her.<br>

                        ANNIE (CONT'D)
             You're gonna make me sit in the
             back seat?<br>

                       RHODES
             Yes, c'mon.<br>

She goes around to the other side and as she's getting in
Rhodes pushes her head down like she's under arrest.<br>

                    RHODES (CONT'D)
          Sorry, force of habit.<br>

He closes the door and jumps in the driver's seat. As the
car pulls away we continue to hear their conversation.<br>

                    ANNIE (O.S.)
          Can I please get in the front seat?<br>

                    RHODES (O.S.)
          Actually I'm afraid there is a
          warrant out for your arrest.<br>

                    ANNIE (O.S.)
          What!? Why?<br>

                    RHODES (O.S.)
          Reckless driving, littering,
          texting, consuming alcohol while
          operating a vehicle. You didn't
          think I was gonna let you get away
          with that, did you?<br>

                    ANNIE (O.S.)
          Can you at least put the siren on?<br>

Rhodes flips on the siren as they drive off.<br>

                     ANNIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
              (smiling)
          Thank you.

          Lill?<br>

                     LILLIAN
          Go away.<br>

Annie sits on the bed and pulls the covers off of Lillian's
face.<br>

                    ANNIE
          What happened?<br>

Lillian has been crying, and continues to.<br>

                    LILLIAN
          This whole wedding is fucked up.
          Helen took over everything.
          Everything's gotten out of control.
          My dad can't afford the wedding.

This has been really hard to do
without you. It's been shitty.<br>

             ANNIE
I'm sorry.<br>

          LILLIAN
Nope, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I kicked
you out of my wedding. It's my
fault.<br>

           ANNIE
No it's my fault.
    (beat)
I think I'm the one with the mental
problems.<br>

          LILLIAN
Yeah, wasn't it my turn to be
crazy? The bride is supposed to be
crazy.<br>

          ANNIE
Yes, technically.<br>

          LILLIAN
You kind of stole all the crazy.<br>

          ANNIE
I out-crazied you. Everything is
going to be okay.<br>

          LILLIAN
How do you know that? At the
rehearsal dinner last night I told
Dougie I had to get Q-Tips and all
of a sudden I was driving here. I
came here. I realize this is the
last time I'm going to be here.
With that couch and this bed.
Taking a bath in my bathtub. You
know how much I love my bathtub.<br>

          ANNIE
    (humoring her kindly)
It's a good tub. I slept in there
on my 30th birthday.<br>

          LILLIAN
I remember. Everything is going to
change.
    (tearfully)

          I'm not going to get to live five
          minutes away from you. That makes
          me so sad.<br>

Annie soaks this in, and although sad, sees this is her time
to be there for Lillian.<br>

                    ANNIE
          Don't be sad. Things are going to
          change, but they'll be better.
          You're gonna take this huge, great,
          beautiful step. And Dougie loves
          you more than anything and so do I.<br>

                    LILLIAN
          But what about you? What's going to
          happen to you?<br>

Annie realizes she's going to be okay.<br>

                    ANNIE
          I'll be fine. Don't worry. I am
          fine. Besides, you need to blaze
          the trail for me and then report
          back and tell me what's coming.<br>

                    LILLIAN
          Whatever you say, boss.<br>

They smile and hug.<br>

                    ANNIE
          C'mon, put on your dress and let's
          go to your wedding.

          Perry never wants to talk to me
          either. He travels a lot, like all
          year. I'm basically just by myself.<br>

                    ANNIE
          I don't feel sorry for you.<br>

                    HELEN
          You know I really liked that
          original dress you picked at the
          bridal store. I thought it was
          beautiful, you have really lovely
          taste.<br>

                    ANNIE
          Thanks. But it's a little too late
          for that.<br>

Helen's hands and body contort and her face gets redder and
sweatier.<br>

                    HELEN
          And I don't think that Brazilian
          food really gave us food poisoning.<br>

                       ANNIE
          No it did.<br>

                    HELEN
          No, I don't think it did.<br>

                    ANNIE
          It was the food. I shit my pants.<br>

                    HELEN
          I don't think that was your fault.<br>

                    ANNIE
          No, that was my fault.<br>

                    HELEN
          I think people only ask me to do
          their weddings because I'm good at
          organizing parties.<br>

Helen is now beet red and looks almost like she's in pain as
she fights with every muscle in her body to remain composed.
Annie looks disturbed.<br>

                    HELEN (CONT'D)
          I don't have any female friends.

INT. JUDY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER<br>

The kitchen is a mess as Annie bakes something, very focused.<br>


INT. JUDY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER<br>

Annie walks up and smiles at her mom.<br>

                      JUDY
            What's going on?<br>

Annie hugs her mom.<br>

                      ANNIE
            Nothing. I love you.<br>


      INT. BILL COZBI'S BODY SHOP - DAY<br>

      Annie stands looking at her fixed and cleaned-up car as BILL
      COZBI, a big pleasant mechanic in his 50's, writes her bill.
      Judy sits reading an ancient magazine in the waiting area.<br>

                          ANNIE
                Wow, it looks fantastic.<br>

                          BILL
                Rhodes and I worked a deal out way
                back when so it's on the house.<br>

                          ANNIE
                Are you serious?<br>

      Annie sees something warm in him, sparks an idea.   She walks
      over and grabs her mom. Drags her over.<br>

                          ANNIE (CONT'D)
                This is my mom, Judy.<br>

      Annie motions for her mom to talk to Bill, then leaves.<br>

INT. ANNIE'S MOM'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER.<br>

Megan puts the dogs on the porch then closes the door.   Then
she sits on the couch with Annie.<br>

                    ANNIE
          And say what? Hi, I can't get off
          the couch. I got fired from my job,
          I got kicked out of my apartment, I
          can't pay any of my bills, my car
          is a piece of shit, I don't have
          any friends --<br>

Megan stands up and starts pacing then gets in Annie's face.<br>

                    MEGAN
          You know what I find interesting
          about that Annie? It's interesting
          to me that you have absolutely no
          friends. Do you know why that's
          interesting? Here's a friend
          standing directly in front of you
          trying to talk to you and you
          choose to talk about having no
          friends.<br>

                    ANNIE
          You know what I mean.<br>

                    MEGAN
          You know what I think?<br>

She pokes Annie.   Then continues to prod and push her as she
talks.<br>

                    MEGAN (CONT'D)
          You don't want help. You want a
          pity party.<br>

                    ANNIE
          No, I don't. Stop it.<br>

                    MEGAN
          You're an asshole Annie.<br>

Megan shoves Annie.<br>

                    ANNIE
          Ow. What are you doing?<br>

                    MEGAN
          What? Am I bothering you? I'm
          life. Life bothering you? Life's
          hard, huh? Life can push you
          around. I'm your life. You're
          gonna let life bite you on the ass?<br>

Then Megan sits on top of Annie and holds her arms.<br>


                    MEGAN (CONT'D)
          I'm trying to get you to fight for
          your shitty life and you won't do
          it. I'm your shitty life Annie.<br>

Annie SMACKS Megan hard in the face.<br>

                    ANNIE
          Oh my god, I'm sorry.<br>

Megan looks like she might get mad, but then she smiles.<br>

                     MEGAN
          I'm not. Nice hit. I'm glad to see
          you've got a little bit of spark in
          you. I knew that Annie was in there
          somewhere.
              (then)
          I think you're ready to hear a
          little story about a girl named
          Megan who didn't have a very good
          time in high school. I'm referring
          to myself when I say Megan, it's me
          Megan. I know you look at me now
          and think, boy she must have
          breezed through high school. Not
          the case Annie. This was not easy
          going up and down the halls with.
          They used to try to blow me up.
          People used to throw firecrackers
          on my head in high school.
          Firecrackers, literally, not
          figuratively. They called me a
          freak. Do you think I let that
          stop me? Do you think I went home
          crying to my mommy, "Oh, I don't
          have any friends." I did not. You
          know what I did? I pulled myself
          up, I studied hard, I read every
          book in the library and now I work
          for the government and have the
          highest possible security
          clearance. Don't repeat that. I
          cannot protect you. I know where
          all the nukes are and I know the
          codes.<br>

                    ANNIE
          I won't say anything.<br>

                    MEGAN
          You would be amazed, a lot of
          shopping malls. Don't repeat that.<br>
                    ANNIE
            I won't.<br>

                      MEGAN
            I have six houses. I bought an
            eighteen wheeler just cause I
            could. You lost Lillian. You got
            another best friend sitting right
            in front of you if you'd notice.
            You need to stop feeling sorry for
            yourself. I do not associate with
            people that blame the world for
            their problems cause you're your
            problem Annie, and you're also your
            solution. You get that?<br>

This hits Annie.   Annie's speechless.   Megan exhales, winded.<br>

                      ANNIE
            Yes. I just miss her I guess.<br>

                      MEGAN
            I know you do, I know you do. Come
            on, bring it in.<br>

They hug.<br>

                      MEGAN (CONT'D)
            There's the Annie I knew was there.
                (smelling her hair)

          didn't get your tail lights fixed.
          Pretty simple.

          just don't understand that you

          ANNIE
I don't really do that anymore, I
told you.<br>

          RHODES
Why?<br>

          ANNIE
After it went under, I stopped. It
doesn't make me happy anymore.<br>

          RHODES
Just because you didn't make any
money doesn't mean you failed at
it.<br>

          ANNIE
I lost a lot of money. All my
money.<br>

          RHODES
You're so good at it.<br>

          ANNIE
Oh well, let's change the subject.
No more baking, I'm done.<br>

           RHODES
I just don't know how you can not
do it anymore. If I wasn't a cop, I
would still go out with a gun and
shoot people.
    (beat)
I probably wouldn't do that.
    (beat)
You're ok, you know.<br>

          ANNIE
You don't know me very well.<br>

          RHODES
I know you well enough to know that
you're not so bad. You've got some
stuff. You've got bits and pieces
going on.<br>

          ANNIE
Thanks.<br>

          RHODES
I've been thinking about you a
little bit.<br>
                    ANNIE
          About me? Really?<br>

                    RHODES
          There's something about you...that
          sticks.

Rhodes studies Annie a beat. She takes another carrot. It's a
small dried-out carrot.<br>

                    ANNIE (CONT'D)
          Ew, this one's weird.<br>

          Oh, you got the ugly carrot.
          There's one in every bag. You have
          to eat it, it's good luck.<br>

          I'm not eating this.<br>

                    RHODES
          Yeah. I'll eat it.<br>

He goes to eat it.   She grabs it out of his hands.<br>

                      ANNIE
          No, no!    Don't eat it!   EW!!!<br>

She throws it on the ground.<br>

From Min Jin Lee<br>
I am very vulnerable. You could hurt my feelings. That's one of my problems is that I'm constantly worried, and anxious, and insecure. I have actually used the verb several times today of how I'm afraid. And actually, that's actually an adjective. But I fear. I worry. And part of it is because sometimes people try to make me feel inauthentic because my Korean language skills are actually quite poor. And I used to feel really bad about it. And now, I don't feel bad about it anymore, like, not even a little bit... I want you to have courage for whatever people try to make you feel inauthentic about. Because when people try to make you feel ashamed, because they may have expertise and you do not, you have to wonder, why are they doing that? That's not encouraging anybody. And it's certainly not an educational idea. Pedagogically, it's stupid. So one of the things I want to encourage you think about is that it's impossible at the age of 22, or even at the age of 50, to be an expert about everything. But I have figured out this. There are people in this room right now who know a shit ton more about Korea than I do. That's awesome. But the thing that I feel like I can do better than most people is that I could feel more and use that feeling more with my craft of fiction. And that's my little field. And I try to do that as well as I can... But I feel like when you do find your field, initially, you're going to be stumbling, but that's normal. So my son is 21 years old. And very often, when he feels like something is not going well, I think, well, is it because it's difficult or if it's because it's unfamiliar to you. It's a very different thing. When you stat soemthing, it's unfamiliar, but it doesn't mean that you're bad at it. It's just unfamiliar. But i really encourage you to find your field. And if people try to make you feel ashamed, I want you to know that it's their shame, not yours.

From Min Jin Lee<br>
I don't think I speak for anybody. I don't. And I wouldn't take that on. That said, I think people think I speak for a lot of people. And all people of color, and all women, tend to have the burden of representation, which I think is kind of heavy. I find it to be a kind of a drag... So I write [the book] for me... People often ask, "Who do you think of as your ideal reader?" And I always say my sister because she thinks I'm great. It's really helpful to have somebody in your life who thinks you're great. And she likes my work. My older sister, she always reads everything I write. Very helpful. So I don't think I even speak for my sisters... But I do think of an ideal reader who loves me and thinks that my thoughts might have some value. Because, you know, the world isn't waiting for women of color to start talking. So we have to decide, maybe we'll say something, maybe they'll hear us, maybe they'll come on a snowy day. I can't believe it. But they did. So I encourage you to speak. And I wouldn't say that you're speaking for me. But I would say that when you do speak, it gives me courage.

From Min Jin Lee<br>
I believe in reconciliation and reunion. With all my heart, I do. And I believe the only way we can think about other people is through empathy, and that's hard to do. And one of the things that I really hasten all of us against is to tell people what to do. I encourage. I try to create drama. I hope that you find yourself in the story. I sort of joke that my agenda in life is to make all of you Korean. Because I think that if I can make all of you Korean, then you would see that all of us are connected. But I think that being didactic doesn't seem to work. And I think that forgiveness is a difficult, difficult thing. It's difficult for everybody, especially for those of us who've been injured and for those of us who injure... Because I'm really angry about a lot of things. So sometimes I'm not in a position to forgive. I'm still mad. But I tend to work it out through my drama, but in terms of a message, I don't think I have a message about the Japanese. I do think that what I have tried to do is to be honest about the history... I think it would be preposterous for us to think that Japanese people are evil... But what I do think is evil, and I believe in the existence of evil, is dishonesty about one's history. So I think that if we are honest about history, then we can begin to consider reconciliation.

I want to say a couple things here about the place[Pioneer Works] we're in. This is not a music venue. This is not just a music venue. This is a school. This is one of the places that are doing it right. They're stretching themselves. You know, not everybody is in it just for themselves. When I first came here, when all of us first came here, it was really life-changing because you realize there's so much potential in the world and the people here at Pioneer Works are putting it all on the road, putting their feet on the ground and actually changing things. They do artists in residences here; they have scientists; they got Harvard scholars dying to leave their jobs to come here and try to do something bigger and I just think with the way the world is, you need places like this. They said, "No, we're not just gonna sit around. We're not just gonna sit around and make money and pat our retirement accounts. We're gonna do something that helps people." And that's what I think is really important. So if you're from here and you get a chance, come back here, participate in this place, donate to this place if you can. Be a part of something that's really special because that's what we feel like we're here tonight: it doesn't feel like a Bon Iver show, it feels like we're being a part of what Pioneer Works does every single day here.

INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY<br>
Jojo leads Elsa by the hand down the hall. They reach the
front door and Jojo notices something.<br>

                       JOJO
             Wait.<br>
He bends down and ties Elsa's shoelaces. She watches as he
does this, a small smile creeping across her face. Jojo
finishes and stands.<br>

Jojo winks a PERFECT WINK.<br>
                       JOJO
          Extremely.<br>

He opens the door. Light fills the entrance to the house.
They step outside.<br>

EXT. JOJO'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS<br>

Jojo and Elsa stand on the front steps of the house. Elsa
looks at Jojo and then back out to the street.
A car full of celebrating soldiers drives past - an American
flag sticking out the back.
They take in the view and Jojo does a small fist pump.<br>
                    JOJO
          Yes... we made it.<br>
Elsa turns to Jojo and stares at him.
She slaps Jojo.<br>

             Yep. Probably deserved that.
                 (then)
             So what do we do now?<br>
Elsa shrugs and stands there. And then, ever so subtly, and
very slowly, she begins to sway... rhythmically.

Jojo follows suit and moves his shoulders back and forth.

          You'll never make it out there. You're a

Jojo stands in the room. Alone.
He moves to the dresser and looks at a family photo, then at
the picture of his sister.
His book - Yoohoo Jew - lies on the dresser nearby. He opens
it and starts leafing through the pages, taking in everything
he and Elsa discussed and worked on together.
He stops at a picture of he and his mother riding their
bicycles.
He turns the page and sees another picture, this time it's of
a RABBIT IN A CAGE. Outside the cage is a little boy.
Jojo takes a moment, then rips out a blank piece of paper.

He sits next to the door to Elsa's hideout. He knocks.<br>

          can come to Paris and live with me and we

              (beat)
          Man, it's hot in here.<br>

                    ELSA
          I love you too, Jojo.<br>
                    JOJO
          As a younger brother.<br>
                    ELSA
          As a younger brother.<br>
                    JOJO
          Well then, maybe you could trust a
          younger brother?<br>
She smiles. Maybe.<br>

                    JOJO (CONT'D)
          Okay. Get your things together. We're
          leaving.

From Jojo Rabbit<br>
EXT. TOWN - STREET - DAY<br>
Jojo walks through the ruins of his town. He sees a soldier
playing A PIANO in a bombed out house.
German POWs are being led away at gunpoint by AMERICAN
SOLDIERS.
Just then Jojo hears a whimper and looks down to see a dusty
hand reaching out from some rubble.
Jojo lifts an old door up and finds Fraulein Rahm. She's
dying.<br>
                      FRAULEIN RAHM
            Oh, Heil Hitler, Jojo. Can you lift this
            building up so I can get out?<br>
She does indeed have a building on top of her.<br>
                      FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT'D)
            Tell Hitler I'll be waiting for him in
            Heaven where everyone is perfect.<br>

She dies.<br>

EXT. TOWN - STREET - DAY<br>
Music blares, it's an anthem of some sort. Jojo stares wide-
eyed as AMERICAN TROOPS officially enter the city in a
convoy. Some people are waving, happy. Others are crying.
Officer Deertz is also there, along with and a couple of his
Gestapo agents being taken away.
A WOMAN holding her child waves at the passing ALLIED CONVOY.<br>
                      WOMAN
            The war is over! America is here!
            Everyone is free! We're all going to get
            Levi jeans! America! Americaaaaa!<br>
Tanks pass by. Adolf sits perched on a local STATUE. He's
disheveled and looks frightened.<br>


EXT. BACK STREET - LATER<br>
Jojo walks down a small street. We see more discarded photos
of Hitler and burned Nazi banners.<br>
                      VOICE (O.S.)
            German! Wehrmacht!<br>

Just then a Russian Soldier grabs Jojo by the scruff of the
neck and shoves him into a group of German POW's being
marched at gun point down the street.
Among the group we see Christoph, one the arsehole kids from
the Hitler Youth Camp. He's crying. We also find CAPTAIN
KLENZENDORF, his revamped uniform in tatters.
Jojo makes his way to Klenzendorf.<br>

                    JOJO
          Captain K! What's happening?<br>
                     KLENZENDORF
          Hysteria my friend. We've come to the
          end.<br>
                    JOJO
          Fraulein Rahm is dead. A building fell on
          her.<br>
                    KLENZENDORF
              (wiping away a tear)
          And my dear Finkel is gone too. I was
          very fond of him.<br>
They're led into a private COURTYARD.<br>

EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS<br>
They're jostled about, pushed and shoved into groups.<br>
                    RUSSIAN SOLDIER
          Move! You, move there!<br>
                     KLENZENDORF
          Hey Jojo. I'm sorry about Rosie. She was
          a good person. An actual good person.
          And I've been meaning to tell you, I
          think your book is really great. I'm
          sorry for laughing at it. There's some
          very important stuff in there. I wish it
          was around when all this started.
              (beat)
          You're a good kid. Now go home and look
          after that sister of yours.<br>
He clocks a RUSSIAN SOLDIER approaching. Klenzendorf smiles
at him for a moment before ripping off Jojo's jacket and
shoving him to the ground.<br>

                       KLENZENDORF (CONT'D)
             Get away Jew!<br>
The soldier levels his gun at them.<br>
                       RUSSIAN SOLDIER
             What's going on? You are a Jew?<br>
                       KLENZENDORF
             Yes. He's scum.<br>
                       RUSSIAN SOLDIER
             Shut up, Nazi.
                 (to Jojo)
             You know this Nazi?<br>
                       JOJO
                 (pointing at Klenzendorf)
             He helped us...<br>
                       RUSSIAN SOLDIER
             He is Nazi.
                 (to Klenzendorf)
             You know the boy?<br>

A brief moment as Klenzendorf stares at Jojo.<br>
                       KLENZENDORF
             I don't know this dirty Jew.<br>
                       JOJO
          What?<br>
                       KLENZENDORF
             Ugly Jew brat!<br>
The soldier smashes Klenzendorf square in the face with the
butt of his rifle.<br>
                       RUSSIAN SOLDIER
             Shut your mouth Nazi.
                 (to Jojo)
             Jew, get out of here. Go home.<br>

                       JOJO
             No!<br>
He and Klenzendorf exchange one more look before the soldier
grabs Jojo and pushes him out onto the street. The large
gates close behind him.
Jojo gets to his feet and dusts himself off.

MACHINE GUN FIRE rings out from inside the courtyard.
Jojo runs and, turning a corner...<br>

EXT. TOWN - STREET - MOMENTS LATER<br>
...bumps straight into Yorki. He's covered in dirt and ash
and has lost his uniform. He now wears only underpants and an
undershirt.<br>
                    YORKI
          Jojo!<br>
                    JOJO
          Yorki! I thought you were dead.<br>
                    YORKI
          No, it seems I can never die.<br>
                    JOJO
          I don't understand what's happening.<br>
                     YORKI
          Me neither. Nothing makes sense. It's
          definitely not a good time to be a Nazi.
              (beat)
          I'm gonna go home and see my mother. I
          need a cuddle. Hey. So now the war's over
          at least your girlfriend will be free.
          She can leave now.<br>
Jojo steps back realizing Elsa may leave.<br>
                    JOJO
          I have to go.<br>
He wonders off pondering and confused.<br>
EXT. JOJO's HOUSE - DAY<br>
Jojo slowly wanders up to his house, pauses a moment outside
the front door , and walks inside.

From Jojo Rabbit<br>
Yorki sees Jojo, waves, trips and falls. The Rocket Launcher
hits the ground and fires - sending a missile across the road
where it blows up a shop. GLASS and DEBRIS shower the street.<br>
                       YORKI
            Scheisse! I'm so clumsy.
                (beat)
            Jojo! I've missed you. I'm sorry about
            your mama. I cried for ages when I heard
            what happened.<br>
They hug.<br>
                      JOJO
            Yorki, what's going on out there?<br>
                      YORKI
            The Russians Jojo, they're coming. And
            the Americans from the other way. And
            England and China and Africa and India
            and Australia. The whole world is coming!<br>

                      JOJO
            How are we doing?<br>
                       YORKI
             Terribly! Our only friends are the
             Japanese and just between you and me,
             they don't look very Aryan. Germany's
             completely run out of money.
                  
             I mean look at this uniform, it really IS
             made of paper. They just glued cotton on
             top of it.<br>
He turns around and we see the back of his jacket has been
completely burned off.<br>
                       YORKI (CONT'D)
             I gotta get this ammo to the gunners. You
             can help.<br>
Yorki puts the ammo in Jojo's barrow and they head off.<br>

EXT. TOWN - STREET - DAY<br>
The kids make their way down a street, the fire-fight in the
distance getting closer. It's loud and chaotic. Other
soldiers run around, old people and kids mainly.<br>
                       JOJO
             Hey, remember that Jew I told you about?<br>
                       YORKI
             Oh yeah. You caught one.<br>
                       JOJO
             I still have her. She's basically my
             girlfriend now.<br>
                       YORKI
             Good for you Jojo! A girlfriend!<br>
                       JOJO
             But she's, y'know... Jewish.<br>
                    YORKI
          There are bigger things to worry about
          than Jews, Jojo. There's Russians
          somewhere out there. They're worse than
          anyone. I heard they eat babies and have
          sex with dogs. I mean, that's bad, right?<br>
                       JOJO
             Sex with dogs?<br>
                       YORKI
             Yeah, the Englishmen do it too. We have
             to stop them before they eat us and screw
             all our dogs. It's crazy. And now
             Hitler's gone we're really on our own.<br>

                     JOJO
             What?<br>
                    YORKI
          You didn't hear? He's dead. He gave up
          and blew his brains out.<br>
                    JOJO
          No. That's impossible!<br>

                    YORKI
          Blew them out. His brains. Turns out he
          was hiding a lot of stuff from us. Doing
          some really bad things behind everyone's
          backs. I'm not sure we chose the right
          side.<br>
Jojo and Yorki round a corner. As they approach another
MACHINE GUN POST we see an ENEMY TANK in the distance trained
on the fortification.
It fires and there's a huge explosion. The boys drop
everything and RUN OFF.<br>


EXT. BATTLE GROUND - CONTINUOUS<br>
The fighting is more intense and we see more KIDS and OLD
PEOPLE, dressed in stupid paper uniforms, huddled in corners,
trying to figure out what to do. Some are crying.
The boys round a corner and find Fraulein Rahm preparing for
battle. She's sticking a GRENADE into the back pocket of a
CLONE.<br>
                    FRAULEIN RAHM
          Ok, little clone! Go find a Russian or an
          American and give them a big hug!<br>
She pulls the PIN on the grenade and sends the kid out into
the battle.<br>
                    YORKI
          Y'know, I'm not sure we chose the right
          side. I'm beginning to wonder if we might
          be the bad guys.<br>
                    FRAULEIN RAHM
          Yorki! Here, you've been promoted. Take a
          gun and go kill anyone who looks
          different to us! Go! Go! Go!<br>
She shoves Yorki out into battle.<br>

                       FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT'D)
             Jojo! Here, put on a jacket so you know
             what side you're on!<br>
She hands Jojo a jacket.<br>
                       FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT'D)
             The Russians are over there! The
             Americans are that way! We must kill
             everything we see! For HITLER!<br>
She grabs a massive MACHINE GUN and runs out into the fray.<br>
                    FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT'D)
          Die, DEVIL SCUM!!!<br>
Suddenly there's a huge explosion and the street is engulfed
in smoke and dust - Jojo and Yorki are separated.<br>
                       YORKI (O.S.)
             Jojo!<br>
                       JOJO
             Yorki! Where are you?<br>

But Yorki has disappeared. More shots and yelling.
Dazed and disoriented, Jojo makes his way through the haze of
smoke and debris, passing the last defenders of the town -
women, children, the elderly - all desperately trying to fend
off a much stronger enemy, and failing.
KLENZENDORF runs past. We see that he is wearing his uniform
but it has been altered according to his earlier drawing. It
has SPARKLY SEQUINS on the collar, TASSELS down the sleeves.
FINKEL is with him, dressed in a similar outfit. There is an
electric energy between them. Klenzendorf sees Jojo, gives a
triumphant smile, and runs off.
Jojo follow suit and finds shelter behind a wall. He watches
as German soldiers retreat from the enemy. Some are gunned
down, others hide behind vehicles and continue to engage.

There are fires burning throughout and the scene echoes the
crazed frenzy of the book burning bonfire from earlier. Only
this time everyone is confused, freaked out and crying.
Jojo ducks into a doorway and hides in a hole.

EXT. JOJO'S HOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT<br>
Jojo and Elsa sit on the ROOF while distant bombing lights up
the horizon.<br>
                    JOJO
          Did you know?<br>

                     ELSA
          She didn't tell me much, only that she
          worked with friends and that your father
          was so mehow involved from afar.<br>
                    JOJO
          No, he's fighting in the war.<br>
                    ELSA
          She said he'll return as soon as the war
          is over. She didn't want to tell you
          anything for obvious reasons.<br>
                    JOJO
              (nodding, tearing up)
          Because I'm a Nazi. Because she hated me.
          I'm the enemy.<br>
                    ELSA
          She didn't want you to know anything that
          could get you in trouble. She wanted to
          protect you - more than anything, more
          than me. You were the most important
          thing to her.<br>
                    JOJO
          But they found out what she was doing in
          the end. They got her.<br>

                       ELSA
             I'm sorry. She died trying to save lives.
             That is the greatest honor any person can
             achieve.<br>
                       JOJO
             But now I have nothing. No one.<br>
Elsa puts an arm around his shoulder. More bombs.<br>

                     ELSA
          The last time I saw my parents was at the
          station. They were put on a train. I ran.
          Slowly found my way back to the city. A
          friend of my father's hid me. Then
          another friend, then friends of
          friends... till your mother took me in.
              (then)
          So far I am still here. But my parents
          went to a place you don't come back from.<br>
                       JOJO
             What is the first thing you'll do when
             you're free?<br>

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - TOWN SQUARE - AFTERNOON<br>
Jojo wheels his barrow down an alley which opens up into the
town square. He rests a moment and sees a BUTTERFLY moving
past him along a row of flowers.
Jojo smiles at this, takes interest and follows the
butterfly, crouching low to the ground, he follows the
butterfly deeper into the square. Low to the ground, he
admires the butterfly which has now come to a stop upon
another flower.
The butterfly flutters away. Jojo notices the light on the
ground is disturbed by shadows moving back and forth.
He stands.
Right in front of him are a pair of shoes, dangling. He is in
the middle of bodies hanging from the GALLOWS. He backs away
from the body and into another pair of feet. We recognize
these shoes. They are his mother's.
He stumbles back, shaking, tears welling.
After a moment he moves back towards his mother. He tries to
reach her hand. It is too high. He looks back down towards
her shoes and notices her lace is untied. He tries to tie
them but can't.<br>

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - TOWN SQUARE - DUSK<br>
As the sun sets Jojo remains in the park, sitting beneath the
bodies. Quiet. Still.<br>

INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - ELSA'S HIDEOUT - NIGHT<br>
Elsa sits in Inga's room, reading by candlelight. Jojo enters
the room. Elsa looks down to see he's holding his DJ knife,
tears streaming down his face.
He walks up to Elsa and stabs her just below the collarbone.
He's too weak to drive it all the way in but she does little
to stop him.

Slowly she raises her hand, places it over his and pulls out
the bloody blade. Blood seeps down her chest. She nods at
him. Jojo struggles against her until he collapses to the
floor. He lies on his back. Elsa kneels next to him. They
look at each other.

INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER<br>
Jojo sits at the kitchen table twiddling his thumbs while
Adolf, wearing oven gloves, stirs a pot on the stove.
                    ADOLF
          So that was pretty much a bust. I can't
          believe they fell for her disguise. Mind
          explaining that?

                    JOJO
          She doesn't seem like a bad person.
                    ADOLF
              (immature)
          Poor Jojo, he's a widdle bit tired and
          confused and the only thing he can cook
          is invisible soup.
He is suddenly serious, elements of the real Hitler start
building as he gives an impassioned speech.
                     ADOLF (CONT'D)
          I am beginning to question your loyalty
          to myself and the party. You say you are
          a patriot but where is the evidence? The
          German soldier was born out of necessity,
          Germany depends on the passion of these
          young men, passion and a readiness to
          fall for the fatherland.
          Their resurrection will be seen in the
          rise of the German folk, despite the
          futile efforts of Allied war profiteers
          who send their ill-prepared armies
          clumsily into the lair of the wolf.

             And only those zealous men who stand
             steadfast in the face of the enemy will
             be remembered, their names etched into
             German memory forever.
             But it is up to you to decide if you want
             to be remembered, or forgotten like a
             grain of sand, disappearing without trace
             into the desert of insignificance!
                 (beat)
             To put it plainly - get your shit
             together and sort out your priorities.
             You're ten, Jojo. Start acting like it.
He walks out, dramatically knocking over a cup.

INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - INGA'S BEDROOM - DAY<br>
Jojo lightly taps on Elsa's wall, opens the door and holds
something out for her: the coloured pencils.<br>
                       JOJO
             You can have them. I don't care. They're
             probably broken. Doesn't mean anything.
             That's a good chair.<br>
He walks to chair, looks at it.<br>
                          ELSA
             Thank you.<br>

                       JOJO
             Yeah well, maybe you can draw some more
             pictures for my book. Or not.<br>
                       ELSA
             I could draw you again?<br>
                   JOJO
         No one wants to see pictures of cripples.<br>

                   ELSA
         You're hardly a cripple. Besides, true
         artists don't see that stuff.<br>
                    JOJO
         Blind artists you mean. Look, it's fine,
         I'll just accept that I'll be one of
         those guys who will never get to kiss a
         girl.
             (beat)
         And I'm not fishing for anything by the
         way. I feel quite strongly about this.<br>
                        ELSA
             You will be kissed, Jojo.
                 (beat)
             Do you want me to kiss you?<br>
                   JOJO
         Ok, two things. Thing number one: it's
         illegal for Nazis and Jews to hang out
         like we do, let alone kiss, so already
         it's out of the question. And thing
         number two: it would just be a sympathy
         kiss which doesn't count.<br>
                   ELSA
         You're not a Nazi.<br>
                   JOJO
         What are you talking about? Of course I
         am.<br>
                   ELSA
         Not a real Nazi.<br>
                       JOJO
             I'm massively into Swastikas so I think
             that's a pretty good sign right there.<br>

                    ELSA
          You're not a Nazi, Jojo. You're a 10 year
          old kid who ‘likes' Swastikas and ‘likes'
          dressing up in a funny uniform and wants
          to be part of a club. But you're not one
          of them. Not you.<br>
                    JOJO
              (rolling his eyes)
          Okayyy, let's just agree to disagree,
          alright?
              (beat, to himself)
          Not a Nazi, ha.<br>
He picks at an imaginary thing on the wall. Elsa stares at
herself in the mirror.<br>
                    ELSA
          What a dirty Jew.<br>
Jojo shuffles nervously. He opens the bedroom door.<br>

INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER<br>

Elsa soaks in the tub while Jojo sits outside the door.<br>

INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - ROSIE'S ROOM - LATER<br>
Jojo sits on the bed as Elsa brushes her hair.
Yep, she's beautiful.
As he watches her, Jojo shivers a little. He looks down and
sees butterflies in his stomach, then looks back at Elsa,
worried.
Yep, he's in love.<br>

INT. JOJO'S H OUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY<br>
Downstairs, Elsa looks around, trying out chairs, looking at
photos, taking in the normality of the room.<br>
                    ELSA
          ‘Living room'. Funny name.<br>
                    JOJO
          Stay away from the windows.<br>
Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the door. They freeze.<br>

                       JOJO (CONT'D)
                 (whispering)
             She's home. You better hide.
                 (calling out)
             Lost your key, Mama?<br>

INT/EXT. JOJO'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS<br>

Jojo reaches the door and opens it, revealing FIVE MEN in
trench-coats - GESTAPO AGENTS - led by an intense fellow
named CAPTAIN DEERTZ.<br>
                     DEERTZ
          Heil Hitler. Allow me to introduce
          myself. I am Captain Herman Deertz of the
          Falkenheim Gestapo. This is Herr Mueller,
          Herr Junker, Herr Klum, and Herr Frosch.
              (then)
          Heil Hitler.<br>
                       JOJO
             Heil Hitler.
                 (to Mueller)
             Heil Hitler.<br>
                       MUELLER
             Heil Hitler.<br>
                       JOJO
                 (to Junker)
             Heil Hitler.<br>
                       JUNKER
             Heil Hitler.<br>
                       JOJO
                 (to Frosch)
             Heil Hitler.<br>
                       FROSCH
             Heil Hitler.<br>
                       JOJO
                 (to Klum)
             Heil Hitler.<br>
                       KLUM
             Heil Hitler.<br>
                         DEERTZ
             Now, we--<br>

                       KLENZENDORF (O.S.)
             Sorry I'm late, my bicycle got a flat
             tire. I carried it.<br>
They are interrupted by Captain Klenzendorf entering,
carrying a bicycle, trailed by Finkel.<br>
                       DEERTZ
             Captain Klenzendorf? Heil Hitler.<br>

                       KLENZENDORF
             Heil Hitler. This is Freddy Finkel.<br>
Finkel joins in and the two men Heil Hitler everyone in the
room all over again. Finally...<br>
                    KLENZENDORF (CONT'D)
          So, did I miss anything?<br>
                    DEERTZ
          No, we were just Heil Hitlering each
          other and were about to conduct a routine
          inspection.<br>

He nods to the other agents who start snooping around the
house, inspecting drawers, cupboards, shelves.<br>
                       DEERTZ (CONT'D)
             And what brings you here, Captain?<br>
                    KLENZENDORF
          We were passing by and wanted to drop off
          some pamphlets for the boy. He works for
          us.<br>
                       DEERTZ
          I see.<br>
                    KLENZENDORF
          And yourself?<br>
                    DEERTZ
          Oh you know how it is. Routine
          inspections. We're following up on a few
          leads that will probably lead to nothing,
          but it's all part of the job, isn't it?<br>
Deertz smiles and moves into Jojo's bedroom.<br>
                       DEERTZ (CONT'D)
             So, young Johannes, you're helping out at
             the Hitlerjugend office.<br>

                     JOJO
          Yes.<br>
                    DEERTZ
          Good for you. I wish more of our citizens
          had your commitment.<br>
                    KLENZENDORF
          Johannes is a fantastic volunteer. He's
          very imaginative.<br>
There is a loud bang upstairs, something being overturned.
Jojo and the Officer look up.<br>
                    DEERTZ
          What on earth are those oafs up to? Why
          don't we go upstairs and see. Yes?<br>
He puts an arm around Jojo and they head upstairs.<br>

INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS
They stop at Jojo's mother's room. The officers are looking
through her dresser and wardrobe, under the mattress.<br>
                    DEERTZ
          Do you know where your mother is?<br>
                    JOJO
          No. I think she's in town.<br>
                    DEERTZ
          And tell me, what has she been up to of
          late? Does she get to spend much time at
          home?<br>
                    JOJO
          Well, she is quite busy.<br>
Klenzendorf accidentally knocks over a chair. He exhales
heavily, clearly uncomfortable.<br>
                     DEERTZ
          Is she? Hm. Well it's good to see you are
          still wearing your Jugend uniform.
              (beat)
          But... where is your DJ knife?<br>
Jojo looks down to his little sheath, it is still empty.
From behind them.<br>

                          ELSA (O.S.)
             It's here.<br>
They turn to see Elsa standing at the door to Inga's room.
She holds the knife in her hand and wears a dress and shirt
of Inga's. She looks beautiful and... quite German. Jojo is
wide-eyed, panicked.<br>
                    DEERTZ
          And who might you be?<br>
                    ELSA
          Who might YOU be? And what are you doing
          in my house?<br>
                       DEERTZ
             You live here too?<br>
                       JOJO
             This... is...<br>

                       ELSA
                 (mocking Jojo)
             Thisss... isssss...
                 (to Deertz)
             Speak properly idiot. I'm Inga. His
             sister.<br>
There is an awkward pause. Klenzendorf COUGHS. Jojo tries to
stall.<br>
                    JOJO
          Heil Hitler.<br>
                    ELSA
          Heil. Hitler.<br>
                    DEERTZ
          Heil Hitler.<br>

The others agents join in and we go through another long
round of Heil Hitler salutes, this time with Elsa.<br>
                       DEE RTZ (CONT'D)
             I didn't know you had a sister, Johannes.<br>
                       ELSA
             Well sometimes he'd prefer I was dead.
             Wouldn't you, little Frankenstein?<br>

Klenzendorf looks back and forth between everyone, confused.<br>

                    DEERTZ
          Now, now, no need to attack his
          physicality. It's a war wound. And why do
          you have his knife?<br>
                    ELSA
          I'm guarding my room because he refuses
          to stay out of it.<br>

                    DEERTZ
          What do you have hidden in there?<br>
                    ELSA
              (smiling)
          Oh you know, girl's stuff.<br>
Deertz goes to enter Inga's room.<br>
                       DEERTZ
          May I?<br>
                       ELSA
          Naturally.<br>

He wanders in, inspecting the room. He walks past Elsa's
secret door. Klenzendorf enters, walks past Jojo, eyeing him.<br>
                    DEERTZ
          You see we deal with an overwhelming
          number of reports, denunciations, and
          general investigations which means we are
          severely understaffed and overworked.<br>
Deertz opens the curtains and looks out the window.<br>
                     DEERTZ (CONT'D)
          Now, of course we are indeed interested
          in problems of crime and anti-party
          sentiment, but we still have one greater
          concern; that of the Goldilocksies,
          running amok, taking advantage of other
          people in this city. Sneaking around,
          eating people's food, sleeping in their
          beds... It's quite rude.
               (beat, to Elsa)
          I don't suppose I could see your papers
          could I?<br>
Elsa freezes.<br>
                       DEERTZ (CONT'D)
          Hmm?<br>

                    KLENZENDORF
          Papers, Ms Betzler. Quickly please, we
          don't have all day.<br>
                    ELSA
          Yes, of course.<br>
Elsa goes to a drawer in Inga's dresser and opens it. She
then tries another drawer and another. Eventually she pulls
out INGA'S PAPERS. Her hand is beginning to shake,
Klenzendorf takes the papers from her and looks at them, now
and then flicking a look to Elsa.
POV of the papers shows Inga when she was sick, GAUNT and
PALE; the two girls share a vague resemblance.<br>
                    KLENZENDORF
          How old are you in this photo?<br>
                    ELSA
          They're 3 years old, I was 14.<br>
                    KLENZENDORF
          Date of birth?<br>

A tense moment as Elsa pauses. Pin drop stuff.<br>
                    ELSA
          May 1, 1929.<br>

Another long pause. Elsa wipes her sweaty hand on her dress.<br>
                     KLENZENDORF
          Correct.
              (beat)
          Thank you Inga. Get a new photo. You look
          a bit like a ghost in this one.<br>
Klenzendorf goes to hand the papers to Deertz who waves them
away.<br>
                    DEERTZ
          Wait. What is this... Yoohoo...Jew?<br>
Jojo gulps. Deertz spies Jojo's BOOK sitting on the dresser.
He opens the book and starts flicking through the pages. The
atmosphere is palpable. Slowly Deertz begins to smile, and
then... he giggles.<br>
                    DEERTZ (CONT'D)
              (stifling laughter)
          Oh my... Oh my! Tell me, who did this?
          Was it you, Inga?<br>

                    ELSA
          Yes, it's an exposé on Jews, how they
          look, behave, think. It'll be a gift to
          the Fuhrer.<br>
                    DEERTZ
          This is amazing. Guys, look at this.<br>
Klenzendorf and the others gather round Deertz as he shows
them Jojo's fantastical drawings and writings. There are
pictures of crazy animals and fairies and magical worlds.<br>
                    DEERTZ (CONT'D)
          Where did you get all of these ideas?<br>
                    JOJO
          It's an... exposé. For the Fuhrer.<br>
                    ELSA
          I just said that, Johannes.<br>
                    DEERTZ
          An exposé. Oh, I think he would
          absolutely adore this. Oh my, this guy is
          riding a dragon. “Mode of Transport”.
              (turning a page)
          Ooh, this is a drawing of their anatomy.
          Look, this one here shows the inside of
          their heads. How wonderful.<br>
The officers are all giggling now.<br>
                    KLENZENDORF
          I too am quite an accomplished drawer. I
          actually have slightly better perspective
          and cross-hatching.<br>
Ignoring him, Deertz points at a drawing of David killing
Goliath.<br>
                     DEERTZ
          Oh look, this guy is killing a giant. Oh
          boy.
              (beat)
          And what is this? “Die, Nathan, Die. Ways
          of killing Nathan.” Oh this is hilarious.
          Look at this guy Nathan, look at all the
          ways he's dying!
              (beat)
          Tell me, who is this Nathan?<br>
Jojo looks at Elsa sheepishly. She stares at him for a
moment, then looks away.<br>

                    ELSA
          No one. Just a stupid boy.<br>
Deertz chuckles. The other officers join in.<br>
                    DEERTZ
          Well, I must thank you for this. You have
          really made my day. I do hope you
          continue with it. And, of course, if you
          see anything suspicious, give us a ring.
          Good day.<br>
More Heil Hitlers as they leave. Jojo just stands there,
watching.<br>
                    KLENZENDORF
          We're scaling down our operations at the
          Youth Office, Jojo, so your participation
          is no longer required. Stay home, kid.
          Look after your family. Look after this
          knife.<br>
Jojo nods. Klenzendorf leaves.<br>


INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - ELSA'S HIDEOUT - MOMENTS LATER<br>
Jojo finds Elsa huddled in the corner clutching Inga's
papers.<br>
                    JOJO
          Elsa, you fooled them.<br>
                    ELSA
          May 7.<br>
                    JOJO
          What?<br>
                    ELSA
          She was born May 7, not the first.<br>
Jojo takes the papers and reads. The DOB reads: May 7, 1928.<br>

                    JOJO
          He was helping us.<br>
                    ELSA
          They'll be back. They'll find out she's
          dead. Then I'll be dead.<br>

                    JOJO
          Nobody really knows Inga died. You can be
          her Elsa. It's okay, I'll tell mama
          everything when she gets home. I'll tell
          her I know you, that we're friends.<br>
Elsa retreats away from Jojo.<br>
                    ELSA
          Jew and Nazi are not friends.<br>
This hits Jojo. Elsa buries her head into her hands and
begins to cry. She goes into her hideout. Jojo leaves.

          As part of our preparations for the
          invasion I'm re-designing my uniform.
          Note, the feathers for aerodynamics, the
          sparkly colour to dazzle the enemy, the
          boots are purely decorative.
              (then)
          And this is a Gatling gun mounted with a
          radio which emits annoying music to
          dishearten the enemy.
              (suddenly covering the
               picture with his hand)
          This is all copyrighted by the way.<br>
                    FINKEL
          That means you can't copy it.<br>
                    KLENZENDORF
          Don't get any ideas kid. The kids tell me
          that your father's away fighting. So it
          appears you are now the man of the house.
          How's that going?<br>

                     JOJO
          It's ok.<br>
Klenzendorf chuckles.<br>
                     JOJO (CONT'D)
          What jobs do you have for me today?<br>

                    KLENZENDORF
          I've got one. I won't lie, it's a bit of
          a step-down from what you're used to but
          we need all hands on deck right now.<br>

EXT. TOWN - STREET - DAY<br>

Jojo wanders past torn propaganda posters of Hitler. In his
barrow are various items; a piece of RUSTED STEEL, a LEAD
PIPE, a few NUTS & BOLTS. Jojo chants as he moves through the
town.<br>
                    JOJO
          Metal for Hitler!
          Nuts and bolts!
          Pots and pans!<br>

He comes face to face with another METAL COLLECTING ROBOT.
They stare at each other a moment and go their separate ways.
Just then, Jojo sees a someone familiar. His mother, Rosie.
Hidden from sight within his Robot costume, he watches as she
secretly places flyers around the street - in doorways, on
tables, in letterboxes. She slips away around a corner.
Jojo walks to a little table and picks up one of the flyers
she placed there only seconds earlier. He reads aloud.<br>
                    JOJO (CONT'D)
          Free Germany. Fight the party.<br>

EXT. TOWN - METAL DEPOSIT - DAY
Jojo unloads his barrow of metal into a large pile of other
donated things.<br>
                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Jojo?<br>
He turns to see, Yorki.<br>

                    JOJO
          Yorki!<br>
The two embrace. Jojo steps back to take in his old friend
who is now dressed in a soldier's uniform. A cigarette hangs
from his mouth but it's still the same old dorky Yorki.<br>
                    JOJO (CONT'D)
          You're a soldier now?<br>
                    YORKI
          At your service! I even drink schnapps
          and smoke cigarettes now. Except I don't
          light them because they taste like arse.<br>
He theatrically “smokes” with his cigarette which isn't lit.<br>
                    JOJO
          But you're only eleven.<br>

                    YORKI
          I know! And look at this uniform, it's
          state of the art!<br>
Jojo feels the uniform. It is made out of CARDBOARD covered
in GREEN MATERIAL.<br>

                       JOJO
             It's pretty thin. Is that... paper?<br>
                       YORKI
             Hmm, that's what I thought at first too.
             But it's “paper-like”. It's the latest
             material invented by our top scientists.<br>
He holds up his arm, the sleeve is way too long.<br>
                       JOJO
             Well, I'm impressed. You finally made it.
             Next stop, Hitler's guard.<br>

Jojo shuffles on the spot.<br>
                    JOJO (CONT'D)
          Hey Yorki... I caught a Jew. A real one.<br>
                     YORKI
          Wow, good for you! I saw some that they
          caught hiding in the forest last month.
          Personally I didn't see what all the fuss
          was about. They weren't at all scary and
          seemed kind of normal. But don't tell
          anyone I said that.
              (then)
          Hey what's all that metal stuff? Are you
          collecting metal stuff? This gun's metal
          stuff. Argh, I'm getting distracted, I
          gotta go!<br>
He runs off.<br>

                    YORKI (CONT'D)
          Oh my God it's so hard to run in this
          thing!

              (nodding)
          He's different. He suspects something. He
          thinks Inga's ghost lives up here.
              (beat)
          You remind me of her. You really do. But
          different of course, you're your own
          person. I would love to have seen her
          grow into a woman, but I'll have to watch
          you instead.<br>
She swigs some wine.<br>

                    ELSA
          I don't know anything about being a
          woman. Is that what it is, you drink
          wine?<br>
                     ROSIE
          Sure.
              (beat)
          You'll drink;                     
             champagne if you're happy, champagne if
             you're sad. You'll drive a car and eat
             cake. Gamble if you want, own diamonds
             and learn how to fire a gun. You'll go to
             Morocco, take up lovers and make them
             suffer, look a tiger in the eye and learn
             to trust without fear. That's what it is
             to be a woman.<br>

                    ELSA
          Trust without fear. How do you do that,
          how do you know you can trust someone?<br>
Rosie smiles and leans in.<br>
                       ROSIE
             You trust them.
                 (she kisses Elsa's head)
             Good night.<br>
                       ELSA
             All those other things? Did you do that
             stuff? You know, go to Morocco, and the
             rest.<br>

                       ROSIE
             No.<br>
                 (beat)

Jojo enters his room with a pep in his step. He sees Adolf
sitting in his bed.<br>
                    ADOLF
          You two seem to be getting on well.<br>
                    JOJO
          No, I just... I was making sure she was
          still alive.<br>
                    ADOLF
          What do you care?<br>
                    JOJO
          I don't. But I also don't want a dead
          person in my house. How would you like
          it?<br>

                    ADOLF
              (wiggling his toes)
          I wouldn't care. I'm tough. All the time
          you guys are spending together... I have
          to admit, it makes me uncomfortable.<br>

                       JOJO
             Well, you suggested it in the first
             place. Besides, it's for the book.
                       ADOLF
                 (sighs)
             Okay, sorry. You're right. Oh no, I've
             made it weird between us, haven't I? Is
             it weird? Oh god, it's weird now.<br>

A beat as we process Adolf Hitler in Jojo's bed. It's weird.<br>
                       JOJO
             I'm just tired. I'm going to bed.<br>
                    ADOLF
          Sure, I was just keeping it warm for you.
          Friends do that.<br>
He gets out of bed, dressed in full rega lia, including those
PUFFY-HIPPED PANTS that Generals wear.<br>
                        ADOLF (CONT'D)
             Hey do you think this uniform is
             slimming? I'm not sure about the hips on
             the pants.<br>
                       JOJO
             You look great.<br>
                     ADOLF
          Thank you. Now Jojo let me give you some
          really good advice. Once you see what's
          in her mind and where she's trying to get
          you to go - in your own head, you must go
          the other way. Don't let her put you in a
          brain prison! That, dear Jojo, is one
          thing that cannot happen to a German! Do
          not let her boss your German brain
          around!<br>
Jojo stares at him with admiration.<br>
                       JOJO
             I won't let my brain be bossed around by
             her, mein Führer.<br>
                       ADOLF
             Try not to. It looks like you've got a
             lot of good information in your book, so
             I think it's time to share it with the
             world, yes?<br>

Jojo nods. Hitler goes to leave.<br>
                    JOJO
          Um Adolf, do you think I'm... ugly?<br>
                     ADOLF
          Is that a trick question?
              (he ponders, then)
          Is there another word for ugly but not as
          offensive?<br>
                    JOJO
          I don't think so.<br>
                     ADOLF
          Well if there was, that'd be you to a
          tee. Anyway, ugly isn't a bad thing.
          Field Marshal Rommel was absolutely
          hideous but he made up for it with great
          joke telling abilities.
              (then)
          Sweet dreams, little Rabbit.<br>

once more. He scowls at himself and turns out the light.

             No news from Nathan today I'm afraid.
             He's probably doing something amazing
             like reading a book or growing a beard.<br>
Jojo sighs.<br>

             What's wrong?<br>

After a beat.<br>
                     ELSA (CONT'D)
          You want me to tell you about the Jews?
              (off his look)
          Get comfortable.
              (beat)
          Okay, in the beginning we used to live in
          caves, deep, deep in the centre of the
          Earth.<br>
                       JOJO
          Wait.<br>

Jojo takes a pen and starts writing in his book.<br>
                     ELSA
          Scary places full of strange and
          wonderful creatures all with one thing in
          common...<br>
                       JOJO
                 (nodding, knowingly)
             Stealing the ends of penises.<br>

                 (laughing)
             No you idiot. A love of art.<br>

             You want the story or not?<br>

                       JOJO
             You may continue. But I know it's true,
             the penis thing. Rabbis use them for
             earplugs.<br>

                    ELSA
          Aaaand moving on. So, after many years of
          developing magic and spells, we slowly
          moved out of the caves and into the
          towns. Some of us stayed in the caves, in
          our normal bodies.<br>
                    JOJO
          Which are... blobs or something?<br>

                    ELSA
          Well, I'll draw them for you.<br>
She takes Jojo's book and starts drawing. Jojo watches her
elegant hands as they create the picture. She hands the book
back to Jojo; it is a beautifu l sketch of a WEIRD creature
that is more like an ELF or FAIRY. Definitely not Jewish or a
monster.<br>

          house and hang from the ceiling when we
          sleep, like bats. Oh, one interesting

                    ELSA
          No, their heads are too thick for us to
          penetrate. Like birds, our true language
          sounds like singing. Crystals, glass and
          gold.<br>
                     JOJO
              (writing)
          Attracted to shiny things... but also
          ugly things, Jews love ugliness. That's
          another thing we learned in school.
              (beat)
          Ugly things yes? You love them?<br>
Elsa regards this 10 year-old kid writing as fast as he can,
a manic look on his face. A small smile creeps across hers.<br>
                    JOJO (CONT'D)
          Hmm yes, ugly things.<br>
He pauses, catches a glimpse of himself in a mirror on the
other side of the room. We see his scarred face. He registers
his “ugliness” and goes back to writing.

              (to a passer-by)
          Excuse me, can you help? My child is
          drunk.<br>
                        JOJO
                 (laughing)
             Don't believe her!<br>
                       ROSIE
             "I'm Jojo and I shouldn't trust pretty
             ladies to tie my shoelaces..."<br>
He gets up and tries to chase her. They play like this, him
tripping over, trying to catch his mother, as locals watch.<br>

EXT. RIVER - LATER<br>
His shoelaces now properly tied, Jojo and his mother walk
along the banks of the river. She walks next to Jojo but on
an elevated retaining wall so her feet are next to his head.<br>
                       ROSIE
             You're growing up too fast. A ten year
             old shouldn't be celebrating war or
             talking politics. You should be having
             fun, climbing trees, and then falling out
             of those trees.<br>

                       JOJO
             But the Führer says that when we win, it
             is us young boys who will rule the world.<br>
                       ROSIE
             Pah! The Reich is dying. We're going to
             lose this war and then what will you do?
             All I'm saying is that life is a gift and
             therefore we must celebrate it, hold on
             to it. We have to dance to show God we
             are grateful to be alive.<br>
She does a small twirl next to him, her shoes spinning near
his head.<br>
                    JOJO
          Well I won't dance. Dancing's for people
          who don't have a job.<br>
                       ROSIE
             Dancing's for people who are free. It's
             escape from all of this.<br>
                       JOJO
             Well then you're free to dance your way
             home. I'll ride!<br>
He jumps on his bicycle and pedals away. She gives chase.<br>
                       ROSIE
             Oh no you don't! No one can stop me!<br>
She jumps on her bike and pedals after him.<br>

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY<br>
Jojo and Rosie ride through the countryside.
A truck of wounded and battle weary soldiers pass by, their
young faces sunken and devoid of hope. Rosie waves.<br>
                       ROSIE
             Welcome back, boys! Now go home and kiss
             your mothers!<br>
This makes the boys smile and they wave back, cheering.

From Jojo Rabbit<br>
INT. TOWN - LIBRARY - DAY<br>
Jojo walks down an aisle of the local library. He scans the
scant shelves and finds what he was looking for; RILKE: POEMS
AND ESSAYS. He pulls it out and secretly stuffs it into his
jacket. He turns around and sees Hitler stuffing his own
jacket with about 20 books. They spill out onto the floor.<br>
                     HITLER
          Great thinking, Rabbit. We'll use these
          books to make a fake floor that she can
          fall through, straight into a nest of
          piranhas or hot lava. Or BOTH!
              (cackling sinisterly)
          She won't know what hit her!<br>
                      JOJO
          Shh.<br>
                    ADOLF
          Shh? You shush. Let's get a book and go.
          Libraries are dumb.<br>


INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - JOJO'S ROOM - DAY<br>
Jojo writes a letter at his desk, the Rilke poetry book lies
next to him. Hitler lays on the bed reading a book.<br>
                    ADOLF
          Yeah, this is a really good idea, what
          we're doing right now. If she had a
          heart, this would break it clean in two.<br>


INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - INGA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON<br>
Elsa sits in an armchair. Jojo walks in.<br>
                     JOJO
          I have something to tell you. I came
          across an old letter from Nathan - your
          fiancée - addressed to you. It's quite
          lucky I found it.<br>
                    ELSA (O.S.)
          What the hell are you talking about?<br>

                    JOJO
          A letter from Nathan. I'll read it.<br>
Pause. Jojo reads his letter.<br>
                    JOJO (CONT'D)
          Dear Elsa, this is hard for me to say but
          I don't want to marry you anymore. I
          found another woman and we laugh a lot
          and do the tongue kiss. It's like my
          favourite poet Rilke say s:
          “We need, in love, to practice only this:
          letting each other go.”
          So goodbye and sorry about letting you
          go. From Nathan, your ex-fiancée.
          PS. I am not really in the resistance I
          was lying. I am unemployed and quite fat
          now.<br>
Tears well in her eyes and she retreats into her hiding
space, upset. She closes the secret door, leaving Jojo alone.<br>

INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - JOJO'S ROOM - AFTERNOON<br>
Jojo is back at his desk, writing another letter.<br>


INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - INGA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON<br>
Jojo's back. He knocks lightly on Elsa's wall.
KNOCK-KNOCK. The door remains closed.<br>
                     JOJO
          Hi. Um, don't open the door but I
          actually forgot there was a second
          letter. I forgot I had it. I'll just read
          it.
              (reading)
          Dear Elsa. I just wanted to say that I
          don't want to break up with you now. I
          changed my mind because I don't want you
          to kill yourself over me which a couple
          of girls have done in the past and it's
          pretty stressful.
              (beat)
          I need you to stay alive. Thank God you
          are being taken care of by that kid, who
          I must say is a remarkable young man.
          Beyo nd his years. And brave too.
              (beat)
          And let's still get married sometime -
          even though I truly am unemployed and
          have nothing much going for me. I don't
          even know how to tie a knot or read a
          map. Yours, Nathan.<br>
Beat. The door opens, revealing Elsa looking back.<br>

INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - INGA'S BEDROOM - LATER

             Nooooo...<br>
                    ELSA
          Believe it brother. Just ask Pissaro,

          Moses and the king of them all, Jesus

She does a MAGEN DAVID POWER MOVE with her hands.<br>
                    JOJO
          You're just saying any old name now. I've
          never heard of these people and now I'm
          fed up.<br>
He goes to leave.<br>
                     ELSA
          Hey.
              (he st ops)
          If you find any more of those letters,
          will you let me know?<br>
                          JOJO
             Sure. Ok.

             Bye.<br>
We stay with Elsa.<br>

INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - INGA'S BEDROOM - MORNING<br>
A PEN skids across the floor. Elsa stops it and picks it up.<br>
                    JOJO
          So, I'd like you to draw a picture of
          where Jews live. A typical hive; where
          you all sleep, eat, and where the Queen
          Jew lays the eggs.<br>

                       ELSA
             You really are an idiot.<br>
                       JOJO
             Come on. We have a lot of work to do.
Elsa takes his pen and paper and starts drawing.<br>
                       ELSA
             Where Jews live. Ok.<br>
                       JOJO
             And tell me about your family.<br>
                    ELSA
          I'll tell you about Jews but you are not
          privileged to know about my family.<br>
                    JOJO
          I need background.<br>
                    ELSA
          Let me ask you something. Why are you
          hanging around with me? Don't you have
          any friends?<br>
                       JOJO
             Of course. Yorki.<br>
                       ELSA
             Yorki.<br>

                       JOJO
             Amongst others.<br>
                       ELSA
             Pff...<br>
                       JOJO
             You don't have anyone.<br>
                       ELSA
             I have Nathan.<br>
                       JOJO
             Who the hell is that?<br>
                       ELSA
             My fiancée. I have him.<br>

                       JOJO
             Where is he?<br>

                    ELSA
          Fighting in the resistance.<br>
She holds out a LOCKET with TWO PHOTOS inside. One is a
pretty picture of Elsa, the other of a handsome man, NATHAN.<br>
                    ELSA (CONT'D)
          He proposed to me on the banks of the
          Fluss. He knelt down like a proper
          gentleman, recited a poem by Rilke, and
          when I said ‘yes' we danced into the
          night.<br>
                    JOJO
          Snore. Who's Rilke?<br>
                    ELSA
          A great Poet. Nathan's favourite.<br>
                    JOJO
          Oooh, Nathan's favo urite, yayyy.<br>
                    ELSA
          He's coming to rescue me and then we'll
          go live in Paris.<br>
                    JOJO
          You would turn your back on Germany
          forever.<br>
                    ELSA
          It turned on me first.<br>
                    JOJO
          Yeah well we don't need you. You and your
          stupid boyfriend can shut up and go live
          in dumb... Cheese - Snail - Baguette -
          Land.<br>
                    ELSA
          Now, now, just because you don't have a
          girlfriend.<br>
                    JOJO
          Pah! I'm too busy for girlfriends.<br>
                    ELSA
          One day you'll make time.<br>
He rolls his eyes.<br>

                    ELSA (CONT'D)
          You'll think of nothing else. You'll meet
          someone and spend your days dreaming of
          the moment you can hold her in your arms
          again. That's love.<br>
Jojo takes a moment, under her spell. He breaks out of it.<br>
                    JOJO
          Ridiculous.<br>
                      ELSA
          Finished.<br>
Elsa places her finished drawing next to Jojo. It's of him.
Underneath she has written the word DUMMKOPF.<br>
                     JOJO
          I said to draw where Jews live. This is
          just a stupid picture of my head.<br>
She pushes her finger into his forehead.<br>
                    ELSA
          That's where we live.<br>
She slinks back into her hideout, closes the wall behind her.
Jojo stares at his drawing.

INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT<br>
As MUSIC plays on a record player, Jojo and Rosie sit at the
table, not speaking. Both of them eyeball each other
suspiciously. It's definitely awkward and as we pull out to a
WIDE SHOT, we see Adolf has been sitting at the table this
whole time. He makes a gesture to Jojo that he should
probably leave them to it.
As he exits he winks at Jojo. Rosie winks at Jojo too.<br>
                       JOJO
             Why are you so happy?<br>
                       ROSIE
             Things are changing. The Allies have
             taken Italy. France will be next and the
             war will soon be over.<br>
                       JOJO
             God Dammit. Why does that make you happy?
             You hate your country that much?<br>
                    ROSIE
          I love my country. It's war I hate. It's
          pointless and stupid and the sooner we
          have peace the better.<br>
                       JOJO
             The war will end but it will be the Reich
             who stands tall and proud. We will crush
             our enemies into dust, and when they are
             destroyed we shall use their graves as
             toile--<br>

                       ROSIE
             Hey! No more politics ok? Dinner is
             neutral ground. This table is
             Switzerland. Let's eat.<br>
Jojo watches Rosie. She barely touches her food.<br>
                       JOJO
             You aren't eating?<br>

                       ROSIE
             Not that hungry. I might have some later.
             For now, I'm just going to chew on these
             grapes.<br>
                       JOJO
             Well I'm especially hungry tonight. So
             maybe I'll just finish yours.<br>

Silence. Glaring at her son, Rosie angrily eats her food.<br>
                       ROSIE
             How was your day, Johannes?<br>
                       JOJO
             Oh you know, just wandered around being a
             deformed kid with nothing to live for.<br>
                    ROSIE
          You're not deformed.<br>
                    JOJO
          My face looks like a street map, woman.<br>

                       ROSIE
             That's not my fault, you did that to
             yourself.<br>
                       JOJO
             I wouldn't expect you to understand. If
             my father were here, he'd get it.<br>
                       ROSIE
             Well. He's. Not.<br>
                       JOJO
             I. Know. And instead I'm stuck with you.<br>
Rosie takes a breath, then swigs deeply from a wine bottle.<br>
                       ROSIE
             You want your dad? Hmm?<br>
                       JOJO
             Yeah, I do.<br>
                       ROSIE
             Yeah?<br>
                       JOJO
             Yeah!<br>

                         ROSIE
             Ok fine!<br>
She storms out of the room. A second later she returns
wearing her husband's military jacket.
She walks to the fireplace and scoops up some ash and rubs it
across her face to make a “beard”. Putting on a deep voice
she slams her fist down and yells in Jojo's face.<br>

                       ROSIE (CONT'D)
                 (Dad voice)
             Don't ever talk to your goddamned mother
             like that!!!<br>
Jojo sits back, shocked at the outburst. Rosie walks away and
stands in the corner. After a few beats...<br>
                       ROSIE (CONT'D)
             Paul, what happened?<br>
Her back still to us, Rosie begins a conversation between
herself and her husband.<br>

                        ROSIE (CONT'D)
                 (Dad)
             I yelled at the kid.
                 (Rosie)
             You should apologize.
                 (Dad, to Jojo)
             Sorry kid.
                 (Rosie)
             You call that an apology? Do it properly.
             He misses you. Talk to him.<br>
Rosie-Dad approaches the table and crouches before Jojo.<br>

                 (Dad, to Jojo)
             Jojo, I know you miss me but I'm out
             there trying to make a difference in the
             world. And while I'm gone I need you to
             take care of my Rosie for me. Can you do
             that?<br>

Jojo nods.<br>
                         ROSIE (CONT'D)
                 (Dad)
             Can ya?<br>
                         JOJO
             Yes.<br>

                    ROSIE
              (Dad)
          Thanks. She's doing what she can.<br>
                    JOJO
              (smiling)
          Yes dad.<br>
                    ROSIE
              (Dad)
          We've got a good kid there, Rosie. I love
          him to bits.<br>
                    JOJO
          I love you too, dad.<br>
                    ROSIE
              (Dad)
          Almost as much as I love this stuff!<br>
She grabs a bottle of wine from the table and takes a big
swig from it.<br>
                     ROSIE (CONT'D)
              (Dad)
          Boy does that taste good. Reminds me of
          dancing with my Rosie at The Red Salon.
          Remember, honey?
              (Rosie)
          I do, babe.<br>
She stumbles across to the RECORD PLAYER, turns up the music,
and starts dancing like a loon in the lounge.<br>
                    ROSIE (CONT'D)
              (Dad voice)
          Hey kid, don't just sit there. Come dance
          with your parents!<br>
Jojo laughs and gives in. He goes and dances with his mother.
Rosie holds her son close, squeezing him tightly, kissing
him, not letting go.

                     JOJO
          Ok, here's the situation. If I tell on
          you, you'll be in big trouble and I don't
          think you want that. But then you'll tell
          on me and my mother and we'll be in
          trouble which I don't want. And if you
          tell my mother I know, then she'll kick
          you out, which you don't want. And if I
          tell my mother I know, then you'll cut
          off my head, which I also don't want.
              (beat)
          So it's a Mexican stalemate.<br>
                    ELSA
          It's just a normal stalemate.<br>
                    JOJO
          I have some conditions for allowing you
          to stay here.<br>
                    ELSA
          Conditions?<br>
                    JOJO
          Yes. I will not cause any trouble for you
          if you promise to tell me everything
          about the Jewish race.<br>
                    ELSA
          Ok. We're like you but human. Done.<br>
                    JOJO
          Please take this seriously. I want to
          know all your secrets. Kindly refrain
          from sitting on my sister's bed.<br>
                    ELSA
          Why? She doesn't need it.<br>
                    JOJO
          You know nothing of my sister.<br>

                    ELSA
          Inga and I were friends. I remember you.
          Such a funny boy.<br>
                    JOJO
          Enough with the small talk.<br>
Elsa laughs.<br>

                    ELSA
          Ok. Obviously we are demons who love
          money, right?<br>
                    JOJO
              (writing it down)
          Obviously. Everyone knows that.<br>
                    ELSA
          But what people don't know is that we are
          also allergic to food.<br>
                     JOJO
          What?<br>

                    ELSA
          Cheese, bread, meat. Those things will
          kill us instantly. So if you're thinking
          of ending my life, that's the fastest
          way. Also biscuits. Lethal.<br>
Jojo writes this down, stops. He gets it.<br>
                    JOJO
          Very funny. Anyway, there's not enough
          food for you so I don't know what you're
          going to do.<br>
                    ELSA
          Your mother managed to find some bread.
          She's kind. She treats me like a person.<br>
                    JOJO
          But you're not. Not a proper person.<br>

She looks him up and down.<br>
                     ELSA
          Are you?<br>
                    JOJO
          How dare you, Jew. You are weak like...
          an eyelash. I am born of Aryan ancestry.<br>

                    JOJO (CONT'D)
          My blood is the colour of a pure red rose
          and my eyes are blue like sapphires-<br>
Suddenly, Elsa has Jojo in a headlock, twisting his weak arm
behind him. He winces in pain.<br>
                    JOJO (CONT'D)
          Ow ow ow ow ow ow...<br>

She covers his mouth, suffocating him.<br>
                    JOJO (CONT'D)
              (muffled, quiet)
          Mmmph!<br>
                    ELSA
          Break free.<br>
                      JOJO
          Mmrrmmph.<br>
                    ELSA
          Break free, great Aryan.
              (leaning in close)
          There are no weak Jews. I am descended
          from those who wrestle angels and kill
          giants. We were chosen by God. You were
          chosen by a pathetic little man who can't
          even grow a full moustache.<br>
His struggle is useless, he cannot break her grip. She
releases him and pushes him onto Inga's bed.<br>
                    ELSA (CONT'D)
          The stronger race, huh?<br>
She goes into her hideout and closes the door behind her.
Jojo sits there, not sure how else to proceed.<br>

                      JOJO
          Ok, that's enough for today. We'll
          continue tomorrow. Okay?
              (beat)
          Okay?
              (then )
          Okay.<br>

Jojo packs his book away and leaves.

From Jojo Rabbit<br>
                      JOJO
             Can I ask you about Jews?<br>
                       KLENZENDORF
             Oh God, why?<br>
                       JOJO
             What should I do if I see one?<br>
                    KLENZENDORF
          If you see a Jew then we tell the Gestapo
          and they tell the SS and then they go and
          kill the Jew. And anyone who helped the
          Jew. And, because these are very paranoid
          times, probably some other people just in
          case. It's a pretty drawn out process.<br>
Jojo gulps.<br>
                    JOJO
          Even if the Jew hypnotised someone to
          make them hide the Jew in the first
          place?<br>
                    KLENZENDORF
          I'd be amazed if that could happen.<br>
                    FRAULEIN RAHM
          It can. It happened to my uncle. This Jew
          hypnotised him into drunk fishing and he
          drowned.
              (to Jojo, suddenly probing)
          Did you see one? A Jew?<br>

                    JOJO
          Nope. I'm not sure I'd be able to tell if
          I did.<br>
                    KLENZENDORF
          Me neither. Without their funny hats it's
          damn near impossible. Someone should
          write a book on the subject. It'd make
          everything a lot easier.<br>
This sparks an idea in Jojo's head.

INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - INGA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT<br>
A match is struck and a candle lit. As our eyes adjust to the
flickering light we can make out Elsa sitting in the
darkness. We then follow the match to find Rosie. She
produces bread, some pickle and a slice of cheese. Elsa
begins gobbling it down.<br>
                     ROSIE
          You have to be more quiet. He heard
          noises up here. He can't know. If he does
          it's the end of you. If I have to choose
          between you and my son...
              (beat)
          I won't know where to send you. You hear
          me? He must not know because if he knows,
          then they know.<br>
                       ELSA
             You could reason with him.<br>
                       ROSIE
             You don't know him. He's a fanatic. It
             took him three weeks to get over the fact
             his grandfather wasn't blonde.<br>
                       ELSA
             Yet you let him go to the Hitler Youth,
             you encourage it.<br>
                    ROSIE
         To get him out of the house and give you
         space.
             (beat)
         You think I don't hate it? It's a hard
         thing to be a mother. But even harder is
         to be the mother of one of them. How do
         you love a son like this, a kid who
         believes the things he does?
             (beat)
         In the end, you have no choice. I know
         he's still in there somewhere, the little
         boy who loves to play and runs to you
         because he's scared of thunder. And
         that's all you have left, belief - hope
         that your only remaining child is not
         just another ghost.<br>
                   ELSA
         Perhaps we're all ghosts now but we just
         don't know it.<br>
                   ROSIE
         Perhaps. You've lived more lifetimes than
         most.<br>
                    ELSA
         I haven't lived at all. And if this is
         living, this hole in the wall and all
         this darkness, then what will death be
         like?<br>
                       ROSIE
             The final escape. But that's the easy way
             out. You're being challenged; they say
             you can't live, that you won't live. If
             that comes true then they win.<br>
                       ELSA
             They've been winning so far.<br>
                    ROSIE
          They'll never win. That is the power you
          have - as long as there is someone alive
          somewhere then they lose. They didn't get
          you yesterday, or today. Make tomorrow
          the same.<br>
She strokes Elsa's shoulder.<br>
                    ROSIE (CONT'D)
          Tomorrow must be the same.

          Yeah, but with just one eye. You can do

INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM Jojo arrives home.<br>
JOJO Mama! I'm home.<br>
He drops his satchel and heads for the kitchen.<br>
JOJO (CONT'D) Mama, Field Marshall Jojo is home.<br>
Suddenly, a noise from upstairs. A small THUD. Jojo looks up.<br>
JOJO (CONT'D) Mama Lion?<br>
JOJO
The bad books. It's not allowed.<br>
Then he sees a candle, bedding, a plate, a fork, AND... ...a SKINNY, PALE CREATURE hunched in the corner, its face partially hidden beneath her hair, dark eyes staring back. Screaming with fright, Jojo drops his knife and stumbles back out into the room. Frozen in fear, Jojo stares into the darkness beyond the secret door. Slowly, a pale hand wraps around the corner, and then a skinny GIRL emerges. This is ELSA KORR.<br>
ELSA
Hi<br>
Jojo bolts as fast as he can, out the door and downstairs where he trips and lands on the bottom landing.<br>
ELSA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Little boy...<br>
STOMP . STOMP. STOMP. Footsteps on the stairs get louder. Eventually Elsa rounds the corner halfway up the stairs.<br>
JOJO
What do you want? Are you a ghost?<br>
ELSA
(smiling spookily)
Sure. A ghost.<br>
JOJO
Get out of my house!<br>
ELSA
Johannes, that's no way to treat a ghost.<br>
JOJO
Why do you live in the wall?!<br>
ELSA
Where else should a ghost live?<br>
Beat. Jojo leaps up and tries to make a run for it, but
before he can reach the door she grabs him by the scruff of
the neck and slams him into a wall.<br>
ELSA (CONT'D)
Don't make me run kid, I'm far too hungry
and you know how much we love the taste
of blood.<br>
Jojo checks his sheath for his DJ KNIFE but it's empty. Elsa
reveals the knife in her hand.<br>
ELSA (CONT'D)
Lose something?
(beat)
I'm not a ghost Johannes, I'm something
worse. But I think you already know that,
don't you? You know what I am.<br>

No.<br>

ELSA
Yes. Say it.<br>
JOJO

Jew.<br>
ELSA
Gesundheit.<br>

You can't be here.<br>
ELSA
Well your mother invited me so I suppose
that makes me her guest.<br>
JOJO
No. It's not allowed.<br>
ELSA
What will you do sweet Hitlerchen?<br>
Jojo's eyes dart towards the door, and then the telephone.<br>
ELSA (CONT'D)
Of course. Go on then, tell them. But you
know what happens if you do? I'll say you
helped me. And your mother too. Then
we'll all be kaput. And if you tell her
you know about me... just one word...
(raising the knife to his
neck)
I'll do the world a great big favour and
cut your Nazi head off. Got it?<br>
She releases him and backs away, still holding the knife.<br>
ELSA (CONT'D)
I think I'll hold onto this. It's pretty.
She wanders back up the stairs leaving Jojo in shock.<br>

Sheesh, that was intense.<br>
Adolf is sitting next to him.<br>
JOJO
What am I gonna do??<br>
ADOLF
Honestly, NO idea. There could be more of
them. In the walls. Hundreds of them...
They look around at the walls. They huddle closer together.<br>
ADOLF (CONT'D)
How the hell did she get control like
that?<br>
JOJO
She used her powers I guess. Mind
control.<br>
ADOLF
Oh, typical. Did you see how fast she
moved? And now she's got your fancy
knife.<br>
JOJO
I know! My knife!<br>
Adolf offers Jojo a cigarette. He waves it away.<br>
ADOLF
You're definitely in a pickle.

Jojo enters Inga/Elsa's room. He's wearing household objects
as ARMOUR; A POT sits on his head, he holds a KITCHEN KNIFE,
and he has a TRASH-CAN LID for a shield. He goes to the
CLOSED secret door and knocks twice.
KNOCK-KNOCK.<br>
JOJO
Excuse me? Hello? Little girl? Um, Jew
girl in the wall?
(beat)
Yoohoo, Jew?<br>
Just over his shoulder Adolf encourages Jojo to continue.<br>
JOJO (CONT'D)
Ok well, I'll just say what I have to say
and that's this: I'm not scared of you
and I think you should find somewhere
else to live.<br>
Adolf taps his watch. Jojo nods.<br>
JOJO (CONT'D)
Ok?<br>
From behind, in his ear, where Adolf was just standing...<br>
ELSA
Not okay.<br>
Jojo spins, she's right behind him, holding his knife
smiling. She kicks him hard against his trash-can lid shield.
He flies back, hitting the wall and collapsing in a heap.
Elsa picks up the KITCHEN KNIFE, flips it in her hand.<br>
ELSA (CONT'D)
Get the hell out of my room.<br>

Argh!!!<br>

INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - JOJO'S BEDROOM - DAY
Back in the safety of Jojo's bedroom, Jojo and Adolf pace.<br>
ADOLF
...and now she's got TWO knives!<br>
JOJO
I know!<br>
ADOLF
How are you going to chop up stuff?<br>
JOJO
I don't know!<br>
ADOLF
And she's still up there! That thing.
That...<br>
JOJO
Jew.<br>
ADOLF
Jew yeah. What do we do about it?<br>
JOJO
You think of something!<br>
ADOLF
Oh, now I'm the expert?<br>
Hitler lights another cigarette, offers it to Jojo.<br>
JOJO
I don't smoke! Stop offering me damn
cigarettes! I'm TEN!<br>
ADOLF
Sorry, this is stressful!<br>
They start pacing, thinking, pacing, thinking...<br>
ADOLF (CONT'D)
Okay, let's talk like turkeys. I guess
you can't tell your mother or the Jew
will cut off your Nazi head. No real way
around that right now. But y'know,
there's no reason this thing in the attic
needs to ruin your life. You could
actually use it to your advantage.<br>
JOJO
How?<br>
ADOLF
Well, when someone tries to use mind-
powers on me, you know what I do? Use
mind powers back on them. Remember last
year when that one-armed pirate, Von
Stauffenberg, tried to blow me up with a
table bomb?<br>
JOJO
Yeah, you survived.<br>
ADOLF
Correct-a-mundo. But the only reason I
survived, apart from having bomb-proof
legs, is because I outwitted old Von
Stauffy. I let him think I was dead when
in actual fact I was fine.<br>
ADOLF (CONT'D)
By pretending I was dead I drew out the
traitors. So, what are you going to do?<br>
JOJO
Pretend I'm dead?<br>
ADOLF
Exactly. Wait. No. I think what I mean is
this: Make her feel safe and she will
drop her guard and then you will be the
one in control.<br>
JOJO
Reverse Psychology.<br>
ADOLF
Don't complicate things. Just use my
backwards mind power trick on her and
you'll be fine.
(checks his watch)
I gotta go. We're having unicorn for
dinner at my place tonight.<br>
Jojo's eyes go wide.<br>
ADOLF (CONT'D)
Concentrate, Jojo!
(beat)
Ok good luck, and remember that ancient
saying: a Jew living in your wall is
better than two Jews flying around with
their bat wings, climbing down chimneys
and eating innocent Nazis. And don't give
her any more KNIVES!<br>
He jumps out the window.
Out on Jojo's worried face.

FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT'D) Also, you could hand out some of this propaganda and deliver these conscriptions.<br>
JOJO I don't suppose I could be conscripted could I?<br>
ROSIE (shaking her head throughout) Great idea! I give you full permission to send this ten year old child off to war. Someone give this guy a gun!<br>
JOJO Actually mother I'm feeling quite fit and would be more than happy to fight at the front.<br>
KLENZENDORF Get in line kid. Besides, you're still on the mend. For now you can start small. Conscripts and propaganda.<br>
JOJO As you wish. I will execute my orders with precision and strength, like a precise... boulder.<br>
FRAULEIN RAHM Just deliver the stuff , kid.<br>
JOJO Jawohl!<br>
He turns on his heels and is OUT.<br>
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY<br>
Jojo pins up some posters of HITLER in a stoic pose, looking off into the distance. Below him is the propaganda slogan: ONE PEOPLE, ONE EMPIRE, ONE LEADER.<br>
Jojo turns and joins his mother who is staring at a make- shift GALLOWS. FIVE BODIES, men and women hang from the cross- beam.<br>
JOJO Yuck.<br>
He tries to turn away but Rosie takes his head and turns it back to the view.<br>
ROSIE Look.<br>
JOJO What did they do?<br>
ROSIE (shrugs) What they could. (beat) Come on.<br>
They leave.

INT. HOSPITAL - WARD - DAY<br>
- A woman's face comes in to focus. This is Jojo's mother, ROSIE BETZLER. As she re aches the bed, she stops, puts her hand over her mouth. Her eyes well with tears.<br>
ROSIE Jojo... my darling cub.<br>
- Jojo's hand raises into shot, reaching out to her. The shot floods with tears, de-focuses, and fades.<br>
INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING<br>
A NEW JOJO stands before us in front of the mirror. He has scars on one side of his face, his RIGHT ARM appears stiff, and he now has a limp.<br>
ROSIE (O .S.) Hey kid.<br>
In the mirror Jojo sees his mother standing at the door, smiling. She hugs him tightly, making growling noises.<br>
ROSIE (CONT'D) My darling little cub.<br>
JOJO Why so happy? Your son is ugly like a monster.<br> 
ROSIE You're no monster. You're still my beautiful Jojo. Besides the doctors are confident those scars will heal and you'll get most of the movement back in your leg. But I'm just happy to have you back home.<br>
JOJO I'll never be in Hitler's SS Guard now.<br>
ROSIE You're fine as you are.<br>
JOJO I need to be better.<br>
ROSIE You need to be you. Mama Lion worries about her cub, that's all. Especially when papa Lion isn't here.<br>
JOJO Or Inga.<br>
ROSIE Or Inga.<br>
INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - LOUNGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Jojo tries to tie his bootlaces but has trouble with only one good hand. Rosie kneels down and helps him.<br>
ROSIE A few more months and you'll get it. You grab the rabbit by the tail, wrap it around his ear, tie it all up and then stuff him back (on) down the hole. (then) Now, we better get on our way. Getting out of the house will do wonders for your recuperation.<br>
Rosie helps Jojo into his jacket. He catches another glimpse of himself in a mirror.<br>
JOJO I don't want to go out there.<br>
ROSIE Don't be silly, of course you do.<br>
JOJO I look stupid. People will stare.<br>
ROSIE Let them! Enjoy the attention, kid. Not everyone is lucky enough to look stupid. What I wouldn't give.<br>
She looks in the mirror.<br>
ROSIE (CONT'D) Instead I am cursed to look incredibly... attractive...<br>
Entranced, she moves in, almost kissing her reflection.<br>
ROSIE (CONT'D) Now, you're going to pluck up your courage, walk out that door and have a fantastic adventure. Okay?<br>
JOJO (nodding, unsure) Okay.<br>
INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER<br>
Rosie parts the blinds on the front door and peeks outside.<br>
ROSIE Field Marshall Jojo, looks like the coast is clear. Now...<br>
Looking over her shoulder, she produces a large, plain biscuit. It's all covert and over the top, but fun for Jojo.<br>
ROSIE (CONT'D) ...many good men died to bring you this. It's a special potato-flour biscuit for emergencies. Emergencies dammit! Not only is it a biscuit, but it also doubles as an eye-patch in case you are invited to a pirate party. It could pass for a shield, an earring, a spare wheel, and even a believable discus should you find yourself participating in a biscuit Olympiad. And in a pinch it also acts as a type of food to sustain you until dinner. (then, peeking out the door once more) Field Marshall Jojo, you're our top man. Prepare to leave the house...<br>
Jojo smiles and prepares himself, playing along.<br>
JOJO Is it dangerous?<br>
Rosie smiles and winks.<br>
ROSIE Extremely.

EXT. WOODS - TRAINING GROUND - MORNING
Jojo sits with a bunch of other kids. Two team leaders, CHRISTOPH and HANS, (21) smoke cigarettes and hold court. Christoph kisses a girl before turning to the kids.<br>
CHRISTOPH When you stand before the enemy and have to end his life, which of you will have the stomach for it?<br>
Everyone raises their hands. Jojo too, although a little slow.<br> CHRISTOPH (CONT'D) There is no room in Hitler's army for those who lack strength. We want hardened warriors who are prepared to kill at will. Can you do that?<br>
OTHER KIDS Yes / Sure / Oh absolutely.<br>
CHRISTOPH Johannes? Can you kill ?<br>
JOJO Pff, of course. I love killing.<br>
CHRISTOPH Good...<br>
Hans uncovers a small cage nearby - it is filled with little rabbits. Hans takes a bunny from the cage and holds it out towards Jojo.<br>
CHRISTOPH (CONT'D) Kill it.<br>
JOJO Hmm?<br>
CHRISTOPH Wring its neck. Kill the rabbit.<br>
JOJO Oh, I'm ok. I might do it later.<br>
CHRISTOPH No later, NOW. Or are you scared?<br>
JOJO I'm not scared. I'm just allergic to fur and I don't want itchy hands all weekend.<br>
Hans shoves the rabbit into Jojo's hands.<br>
HANS Place both hands around its neck and then one hard twist. He might scream but we'll just use the boot to finish it off. Kill... kill...<br>
Jojo, shaking now, holds the bunny and looks at it directly in the eye. He gulps. The boys join the chant.<br>
OTHER KIDS Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill...<br>
The boys are like baying wolves; they crouch in around Jojo as he leans over the rabbit. Jojo DROPS the bunny, trying to shoo it away. But it doesn't run and Hans steps forward, grabs the rabbit, and snaps its neck. Shocked gasps and squeaks of horror from the kids. One of them faints. Probably Yorki.<br>
CHRISTOPH Coward. Just like your father.<br>
JOJO He's not a coward, he's in Italy.<br>
CHRISTOPH No one has heard from him in two years. He's a deserting coward just like you.<br>
HANS Yeah, he's a deserter.<br>
JOJO No, he doesn't do that, he fights.<br>
HANS He's scared and so are you. You're as scared as a rabbit.<br> 
He kicks Jojo to the ground. Hans places a boot on his neck.<br>
CHRISTOPH Scared little rabbit. Maybe we should snap your neck too.<br>
The rest of the kids taunt Jojo. He stands and runs into the woods, trying to escape the laughter. Hans encourages them to chant “Jojo Rabbit” as he runs.<br>
EXT. WOODS - DAY<br>
Jojo sits alone on a log, sobbing to himse lf. He looks up to see a little BUTTERFLY flitting around by his feet... and then a voice comes from behind.<br>
VOICE (O.S.) Poor Jojo, what's wrong, little man?<br>
Jojo turns around, it's Adolf.<br>
JOJO Hi Adolf.<br>
Adolf takes a seat.<br>
ADOLF Why so down in the dumps? A strong boy like yourself shouldn't be sad, you should be happy like a cloud! Clouds don't care about anything!<br>
JOJO They called me a coward. And m y papa, they say he makes desserts instead of fighting. But I know he's still fighting, for you, for me, and for Germany.<br>
ADOLF Oh, of course he is! And he is also making nice desserts, nothing wrong with that. My God, his custard tarts are the only thing keeping up morale at the front. (beat) Want to tell me about the rabbit incident? What was that all about?<br>
JOJO They wanted me to kill it. I'm sorry.<br>
ADOLF Meh, don't worry about it. I couldn't care less. Just like a cloud.<br>
JOJO But now they call me a scared rabbit.<br>
ADOLF Well you want to know something? (off Jojo's nod) Just because they're small and delightfully cute doesn't mean rabbits are cowards. The rabbit faces a dangerous world everyday, hunting carrots for his family... for his country. Forget those boys. They have their place and so do you. My empire will be made up of all animals, eagles, lions, elephants and even the mighty rabbit.<br> 
Hitler offers Jojo a cigarette.<br>
JOJO No thanks, I don't sm--<br>
ADOLF Can I give you some really good advice? Be the rabbit. The humble bunny can outwit all his enemies and that is why he is a hero. Be. The. Rabbit.<br>
He winks at Jojo who tries to wink back but still can only manage a weird double wink-blink. Adolf wanders off. Just then, Yorki arrives.<br>
YORKI Jojo! Are you alright Jojo? Who were you talking to?<br>
JOJO Nobody, I was just out here doing some push-ups for my muscles.<br>
YORKI Oh, I thought you were crying.<br>
JOJO Are you a teardrop specialist?<br>
YORKI No.<br>
JOJO Case closed. Now, Yorki Dorky, it's time for Jojo to show these pip-squeaks who is the real cowardly rabbit.<br>
He takes a deep breath and scurries off into the bushes.<br>
YORKI I'm sorry what are you talking about?<br>
JOJO Never mind.<br>
YORKI Jojo, where are you going?<br>
JOJO To be the rabbit!

INT. TENT - NIGHT<br>
Jojo and Yorki lie awake in sleeping bags, inspecting their new DJ KNIVES.<br>
JOJO Imagine being in a battle, you've just run out of ammo, all you have is your DJ Knife. I would take down 20 of them before they got me. And I'd be laughing when they did.<br>
YORKI I don't like that situation. I don't want to die at all.<br> JOJO Live Faithfully, Fight Bravely, and Die Laughing, Yorki, that's the motto.<br>
YORKI I know but I wouldn't be laughing. I'd probably be screaming.<br>
JOJO Then I'm afraid you might not be cut out for Hitler's personal guard. It's really hard to get chosen y'know. You need to have perfect vision, perfect teeth and you're only allowed a little bit of fat.<br>
YORKI (prodding his chubbiness) Jews sound scary, huh?<br>
JOJO Not to me. If I met one I'd kill it like that. (tries to snap his fingers) Like... that.<br>
YORKI But how would you know if you saw one? They can look just like us.<br>
JOJO Oh I'd know. I'd feel it's head for horns. And they smell like Brussels Sprouts.<br>
YORKI Oh yeah, I forgot about the Brussels Sprouts bit.<br>
JOJO Imagine catching one and giving it to Hitler. That'd be a sure-fire way to get into his personal guard.<br>
YORKI He'd be so impressed.<br>
JOJO Then we would become best friends.<br>
YORKI I thought I was your best friend.<br>
JOJO Yorki, you're my second best friend. First place is reserved for the Führer. He, and only he can have that spot, so unless you're Hitler hiding in a fat little boy's body I'd be happy with 2nd place.<br>
YORKI I'm just a kid in a fat kid's body.<br>

Jojo rolls over and stares at the sky.<br>

CAPTAIN KLENZ ENDORF, weathered, disillusioned, addresses the crowd of kids. <br>
KLENZENDORF Jungvolk, welcome to the Hitlerjugend training weekend in which we will make men and women of you all. My name is Captain Klenzendorf - you may call me Captain K.<br>
FINKEL Captain K! Woo!<br>
KLENZENDORF ...and this is Sub-Officer Finkel. And Fraulein Rahm. (beat) So, a little about me. Who am I and why am I here talking to a bunch of little titty-grabbers instead of leading my men into battle towards glorious death? Great question. I've asked it myself every day since Operation Screw-Up, where I lost a perfectly good eye in a totally preventable enemy attack. And according to my superiors, you need two eyes to be a meaningful part of the war effort.<br>
Beat. He picks up a rifle and quickly fires a shot, hitting a target 100 yards away. The kids applaud.<br>
KLENZENDORF (CONT'D) Over the next two days you little critters will get to experience some of the things that the mighty German Army goes through every day. And even though it would appear our country's on the back foot and that there really isn't much hope us of winning this war, apparently we're doing just fine. (takes a breath, composes himself, he's sad) Anyway. You boys have all been issued with your Deutsches Jungvolk Daggers.<br> 
Jojo and Yorki inspect and admire their nice new DEUTSCHES JUNGVOLK (DJ) KNIVES.<br>
KLENZENDORF (CONT'D) These are very special and expensive weapons, you should never be without them. And don't try to stab each other.<br>
FINKEL No stabbing!<br>
KLENZENDORF This is your first step towards being men. Today you boys will be involved in such activities as marching, bayonet drills, grenade throwing, trench digging, map reading, gas defense, camouflage, trap setting, ambush techniques, war games, firing guns and blowing stuff up.<br>
Huge cheers from the group of boys. Jojo and Yorki smile at each other, this is going to be awesome.<br>
KLENZENDORF (CO NT'D) The girls will practice important womanly duties such as dressing wounds, making beds, and learning how to get pregnant.<br>
Groans of disappointment from the girls. Klenzendorf holds the bridge of his nose as if preparing for the impending headache he's about to endure over the weekend. He sighs.<br>
KLENZENDORF (CONT'D) Alright, let's get to it.<br>
FRAULEIN RAHM Fantastisch! Excellent work children. You also forgot that the Jew is the offspring of Satan and sucks the blood of Christian children for their mitzvah.<br>
Gasps from the children. Finkel nods - I'm afraid so.<br>
FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT'D) It has been scientifically proven that we Aryans are 1000 times more advanced and civilised than any other race.<br>
Gasps and applause from the children. Fraulein Rahm smiles.<br>
FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT'D) Now, get your things together kids, it's time to burn some books!<br>
CHILDREN Yayyyy!!!<br>
A LARGE BONFIRE burns. The children hold stacks of books. Jojo opens his bag and pulls out a small pile.<br> 
YORKI Is that it? Only 4 books?<br>
JOJO It's all I could find on the list. (reading the authors) Kafka... Brecht... Hesse... Burn you losers.<br>
He throws them into the fire, Yorki follows suit. The books land among other burning authors, FREUD, MANN, PROUST, HEMINGWAY, REMARQUE. The children skip and dance round the bonfire, throwing books into the inferno while Fraulein Rahm cackles maniacally.

INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - MORNING
He is dressed. We PULL to a CLOSE-UP, coming face to face with our HERO... JOHANNES BETZLER, (JOJO), a cute 10 year-old boy. The room is covered with NAZI POSTERS and other PARAPHERNALIA, including pictures of ADOLF HITLER. You guessed it, he's a little Nazi. Jojo stares into a full-length mirror and takes a deep breath.<br>
JOJO<br>
Jojo Betzler. Ten years old. And today you join the ranks of the Jungvolk in a very special training weekend. It's going to be intense. But today you become a man. (deep breath, nervous) I swear to devote all my energies and my strength to the savior of our country, Adolf Hitler. I am willing and ready to give up my life for him, so help me God.<br>
A STRANGE FIGURE passes behind him, an ADULT, dressed in a NAZI UNIFORM. It feels ghostly and fantastical. We'll find out who this guy is very soon.<br>
VOICE (O.S.)<br>
Yeah man, that's right. (beat) Now, Jojo Betzler, what is your mind?<br>
JOJO<br>
A snake mind.<br>
VOICE (O.S.)<br>
And Jojo Betzler, what is your body?<br>
JOJO<br>

VOICE (O.S.)<br>
And Jojo Betzler, what is your courage?<br>
JOJO<br>
Panther courage.<br>
VOICE (O.S.)<br>
And Jojo Betzler, what is your soul?<br>
JOJO<br>
A German soul.<br>
VOICE (O.S.)<br>
Yeah man, you're ready.<br>
JOJO<br>
Adolf, I don't think I can do this.<br>
The stranger leans into shot, revealing it's none other than Jojo's IMAGINARY FRIEND, ADOLF HITLER. However, it's not the Hitler we're all used to, he's imaginary and therefore can only know what Jojo knows. He's more of a charming buffoon who floats through life with carefree, whimsical abandon.<br>
ADOLF<br>
What?! Of course you can. Sure you're a bit scrawny, unpopular, and still can't tie your shoelaces without adult supervision, but you're also the bestest, most loyal little Nazi I've ever met. Not to mention you're incredibly handsome.<br>
Jojo smiles. Feeling better.<br>

Now you're gonna go out there and have a great time, ok?<br>
JOJO<br>
Ok.<br>
ADOLF<br>
Ok, that's the spirit! Now, Heil me man.<br>

Come on, you can do better than that. Heil Hitler!<br>

BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY: Screenplay by TAIKA WAITITI. Based on the Book “CAGING SKIES” by Christine Leunens. FOREWORD:<br>
After receiving an email from Taika Waititi in 2010 about the possibility of a film option on my novel Caging Skies, the first thing I did was watch his short films, “Tama Tū” and “Two Cars, One Night.” Afterwards, I went to the cinemas to watch Boy. His fine balancing act between drama and humour convinced me that we were coming from the same place artistically. I can still see him putting his arms behind his head and his feet up on the desk as he observed the sea view from the office we were meeting in for the first time. Funny, down-to-earth, refreshingly spontaneous, it was just Taika being Taika.<br>
That day, he explained to me how he saw the film and what parts of the book he would focus on. My main concern was that I'd seen film adaptations so faithful to the book that they somehow ended up unfaithful in essence, despite the well-meaning intentions. The challenge is that a book doesn't go directly from the book to the screen; it goes page to page. Taika's script had much to take from the book, yet it also had to escape it in order to come fully to life in its own medium. A reader spends a comparatively long time in there on his or her own, days or even weeks, in the dense chrysalis of prose, experiencing the emotions of the story while oblivious to the world.<br>
The script had to break out of all this and be able to fly with its own wings. It had to be lighter than the book. Yet, it still had to handle the condensed weight of the plot, the historical premises, the hopes, dreams and pains of the main characters, while being able to navigate all the tonal shifts. This metaphor of the butterfly finds literal examples in Taika's script/film: the butterflies that flutter in Johannes' stomach as he thinks of Elsa, and another butterfly that will lead to one of the most poignant moments in the film.<br>
Reading the script, I felt that Taika had stayed true to the story, both by what he took and what he so generously gave of himself to it: his heart, humour, inimitable spirit. That's all that I could have hoped for as the author of the book. Where Caging Skies exists as a classical painting, Taika's film is more like Picasso's Guernica – the essential scenes are all there, but he adds his own personal touches. Taika made the bold move to make Hitler an imaginary “friend,” and though comical, in Taika's films, the laughs are never free. Based on the countless images of Hitler courting children's admiration as part of the process of indoctrination, it was a risk that I'm glad he took.<br>
What Taika didn't know back then (when we met in 2010), nor could I have ever had imagined while researching and writing the novel for five years at the Memorial Museum for Peace in Normandy in the early 2000s, is how the world would change. I think people are feeling angst about the future. People just aren't feeling as secure or as optimistic as they were after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Sadly, Caging Skies has become “relevant,” and alas, so has Jojo Rabbit.

REMINGTON ‘What'ya you think of those honeycomb panels. ‘what you were looking for?<br>
MILES Don't know yet.<br>
PETER ...She looks pretty good.<br>
REMINGTON She does, Pete. Lotta cooks in the kitchen now. But I'm sure your pop will have something smart to say.<br>
SHELBY (V.O.) There's a point at 7000RPM where everything fades. The machine becomes weightless. It disappears. All that's left is a body moving through space, and time. At 7000 RPM, That's where you meet it. That's where it waits for you.. Out there among the ghosts. It creeps up on you, close in your ear, and it asks you a question.<br>
KEN MILES DRIVES. Focused. At the very extremity of physics and skill... grace ...balance. Fulfilled. All sound fades except the wind and a ticking clock. Sees his son in the bleachers as he comes round.<br>
SHELBY (V.O.) The only question that matters..<br>
The car bursts out of a corner howling onto the back stretch... speedo flickering above 175mph...180....190...the world motionless but in motion. THEN : KEN MILES HEARS the tiniest of clicks and glances at the gear lever vibrating oddly from side to side.<br>
SHELBY Three small words...<br>
THREE QUICK CUTS : Smith stands off the rail. Shelby emerges from the airstream. Peter and Remington stand. IN THE CAR : Miles pumps the brake. Nothing. Looks up. Calm.<br>
SHELBY (V.O.) "Who are you"?<br>
FROM PETER'S POV -- The distant sound of tires locking. Metal twisting. Smoke rises on the horizon.

From Ford V Ferrari<br>
HENRY FORD II Brief me, Leo.<br>
BEEBE Running one, two and three Mr. Ford.<br>
HENRY FORD II Who's out front?<br>
BEEBE ...Miles and Hulme. You know Mr. Ford, I was thinking wouldn't it be great if all three Ford cars crossing the line, all at the same time. Like lining up and coming home together. Like, Ford, Ford, Ford.<br>
IACOCCA I don't think we can do that.<br>
BEEBE Why not?<br>
IACOCCA Miles is laps ahead, he'd have to slow down. Shelby won't buy it.<br>
BEEBE I don't follow you Lee. What's it got to do with Shelby.<br>
IACOCCA Leo-<br>
BEEBE What do you think Mr. Ford? Be the icing on the cake. Make a great photo.<br>
SHELBY Not gettin' tired now are you, Leo. Look like you could use a break.<br>
BEEBE Oh I'm holdin' up just fine thanks. Shelby. The Deuce would like to ask a personal favor.. What's your answer?
MILES What does Beebe want. You're not doing that thing. So this is either.. ok, or it's off the scale..<br>
SHELBY He wants you to slow down. You're four minutes ahead of McLaren. The Deuce wants three Fords to cross the line at the same time. They want you to be a ‘team player' and give them a picture.<br>
MILES I gotta hand it to him. That's good, even for him..<br>
SHELBY Bulldog, I ain't made a single order stick on your stubborn ass since day one. Whatever you do, it's fine by me. Tie for first, you're still the first man in history to win Daytona, Sebring, Le Mans. You take the big one, the triple crown. Your choice, Ken. It's up to you.<br>
MILES My choice.. How's she handlin'?<br>
HULME
Running at boiling. Brakes are shot.<br>
BEEBE What did he say? Shelby! Did you give the order?<br>
SHELBY Leo, if there was a "Twenty Four Hour of Kissing Ass", you'd be world champion.<br>
IACOCCA Go Bulldog..<br>
IN THE CAR Miles begins to shift like never before. Streaks through a corner in an immaculate apex and guns out into the straight like a rocket, threading past other cars.<br>
IN THE STANDS They're on their feet. Wild. Stamping, chanting Miles' name. All feeling it viscerally..<br>
ON THE TRACK Miles in total control. On the Mulsanne straight, opens it up. The trees strobe. Miles goes faster. Faster.<br>
BEEBE What the hell is he doing?<br>
Beebe crosses to the phone. Dials furiously.<br>
IN THE PIT. THE PHONE RINGS.
Carroll Smith crosses to answer. Shelby glares:<br>
SHELBY Do not answer that.<br>
ON THE TRACK Miles slingshots into the final straight at 232MPH. MILES is flying now. Man and machine as one...<br>
IN THE CAR Miles smiles and begins his final maneuver. Passing one, two, three, four, five cars..<br>
IN THE PITS Shelby watches as Miles navigates the hairpin. Remington stares at his stopwatch. Charlie looks over his shoulder.<br>
CHARLIE ...he's gonna break his own record.<br>
REMINGTON Shut up.<br>
SHELBY Wait for it. Wait for it. Hold hold. (Then) Now.<br>
ON THE TRACK Miles twitches out and threads between the two like a bullet, just making the Apex into the final corner..<br>
IN THE CROWD : Iacocca watching in awe..<br>
PETER It's a perfect lap...<br>
SHELBY Now go..<br>
ON THE TRACK The GT-40 roars up the home straight. Two hundred miles an hour. Two ten. Two twenty. Two thirty. And crosses the START FINISH LINE --- the roaring heart of Miles' GT40 thunders through at 232 MPH.<br>
IN THE PITS The engineers go crazy. Remington hits his stopwatches.<br>
REMINGTON 3.30.6 that's a record!!!<br>
THE GRANDSTAND Explodes! The fastest lap in history, ever. By the greatest driver ever to drive at Le Mans.<br>
IN THE EXECUTIVE BOX IACOCCA goes wild next to a glowering BEEBE who claps slowly.<br>
THE TUNNELS UNDER THE STANDS ENZO FERRARI, cocks his ear, listens to the roar of the crowd above. The cheering fans drowning out even the engine sounds. He walks steps out of an access tunnel to see Miles streak past at unbelievable speed.<br>
ENZO Bellissimo.<br>
AT MILES' HOME IN HOLLYWOOD<br>
PETER You did it. You did it, Dad.<br>
MOLLIE, tears in her eyes, overflowing with love and pride.<br>
IN THE PITS SHELBY nods. The struggle. The heartache. This is it. More than just a race to the finish. This...is greatness.<br>
LEO BEEBE bursts into the pit and runs up to Shelby yelling
but no one is listening to his ravings...<br>
BEEBE Bring him in. He's out of control. He breaks that car, we won't finish. You need me, Shelby. If you don't bring him in, I'll see to it this is the last time you race anywhere but Willow Springs.<br>
Shelby steps away, toward the rail. All eyes in the Ford pit on the track. Witnesses to history. Shelby, exhilarated, living through his friend. Muttering shift and brake patterns... Hands fluttering the movements.<br>
A YOUNG FORD EXEC approaches Beebe urgently. He holds a Le Mans Rule Book. Whispers.<br>
YOUNG FORD EXEC Sir, It won't be a tie. It can't be. Miles can't get a tie if he crosses near McLaren. McLaren started further back at the pole. So if he's anywhere near Miles, McLaren wins 1st.<br>
BEEBE Interesting.<br>
IN HIS GT Miles closes his eyes a moment. Apotheosis. Top of the mountain. He exhales. Centered within himself. At peace. Spinning through space and time. Beyond the reach of each. From this perfection... Miles eases off the throttle. THE BIG NUMBER ONE GT 40 SLOWS DOWN. Dots grow in Miles' rear view. Miles starts to be overtaken.<br>
IN THE GRANDSTAND The grandstand can't believe it. Some realize why. A few boos aimed at the Ford Box.<br>
IN HIS GT. MILES glances in his rear-view. The other GT40's are coming. McLaren in his silver and black GT 40, Bucknam in number 5.<br>
IN THE PITS Beebe watches, eyes bright. Shelby approaches him.<br> SHELBY Sorry Leo, were you saying something to me?<br>
IN HOLLYWOOD<br>
PETER No dad! No...<br>
MOLLIE It's OK Petey. Look! Your Dad's bringing them in. He's bringing them all in together.<br>
OUT ON THE TRACK The cars line up along side each other. Miles in the centre.<br>
IN HOLLYWOOD Mollie gets it. She smiles. Tears fill her eyes.<br>
MOLLIE
Good for you Ken.<br>
IN THE STANDS.. Fans realize what Miles is doing. Some boo. The Ford executives watch. Some removing their hats.<br>
ON THE TRACK Three cars head toward the line. Side by side. The drivers can see each other. Exhausted. Jubilant. Victorious together.<br>
IN HOLLYWOOD Peter watches the Ford team roll to victory. His father in the middle, sharing his victory with his team mates.<br>
OUT ON THE STRAIGHT the three Fords, drive along side by side The reporters go wild. Everybody goes wild --<br>
HENRY FORD II Just beautiful. Look at that!<br>
The crowd erupts AS THE THREE FORDS take the flag together..<br>
CHARLIE They're saying it's not a tie! McLaren started further back! He's travelled further. They say he won, not Ken.<br>
Shelby turns white. He rushes towards Beebe. REMINGTON spots it straight away. Takes off after him. Shelby spins Beebe around. Lifts him off the ground.<br>
SHELBY Where's the goddamn tie!? Did you know! Didn't you? You knew!<br>
REMINGTON Easy Shel-<br>
It takes Remington and Charlie and two others to hold Shelby back. Or they know he's going to kill Beebe.<br>
SHELBY You knew, you bastard!<br>
Beebe steps back.<br>
SHELBY (CONT'D) (cont'd) Get out of my pit lane. You don't belong here..<br>
BEEBE Shelby, honestly, I had no idea I swear-<br>
SHELBY Get out of my goddamn pit!<br>
Beebe turns and walks away.<br>
THE CROWDS SWARM THE CARS -- The drivers get out and embrace each other in front of the grandstand. They are exhausted.<br>
AT HOME IN HOLLYWOOD<br>
PETER He lost? Wait Dad lost the race?<br>
MOLLIE Your dad's fine, my darling.<br>
OUT ON THE TRACK In the chaos, Remington approaches Miles. Quietly.<br>
REMINGTON They boned you Ken.<br>
Ken takes off his helmet. He meets eyes with Shelby as he hears the PA. Realizes he is second, not tied for first. Miles looks into the service tunnel behind the pits. Sees standing there the unmistakable figure of Enzo Ferrari. The old man slowly raising his hand and lifts his hat. A certain gesture. A salute. From one winner to another. Ken Miles nods back. And watches the old man walk away.<br>
ENZO A great achievement. But the finish. All three cars. Gives me hope. They did not come to race. They came to take pictures. Snap snap. Like tourists, they come, take pictures... and they go away.<br>
ON THE TRACK. Miles being congratulated, but looks numb, headed upstream, away from the fracas. His path will cross with Leo Beebe, hurrying to the winner's circle. Beebe sees Miles, slows, apprehensive. Miles raises a hand, Beebe flinches, and Miles pats him on the back.<br>
MILES Congratulations, Leo.<br>
People try to get Shelby to the winner's circle. He flings them aside. His focus is only for... Miles.<br>
SHELBY I never should've asked.<br>
Miles smiles. Looks at his old friend. Shelby nods. They both get it. Miles looks at Shelby. Total truth. Totally no bullshit. Miles breathes. Free.<br>
MILES You promised me the drive, not the win.<br>
SHELBY It was a hell of a drive.<br>
MILES She's a hell of a machine..<br>
SHELBY She's fast.<br>
MILES ...could be faster. The 7 litre's sweet. But we still need a lighter chassis. Was thinking bonded aluminum. It's a ground up rebuild, but if it works we can lose a couple hundred pounds..<br>
SHELBY What are we standing around for?<br>
MILES Let me take a shower, have a cup of tea..maybe a sandwich or something.<br>
SHELBY (laughs) We'll get the bastards next year. </p>

	<p id="858">
From Ford V Ferrari<br>
BEEBE Why are you here? Why are any of us here? We're here to put red paint in the rear view gentlemen. Rivalry between crews. Between drivers. Yesterday's mishap. That's behind us. Obey your pit signals, follow team rules, keep below 6,200rpm at all times. Gurney you're on point, keep to your assigned starting lap time of 3.38, McLaren 2 seconds behind him, Miles you're 2 seconds behind that. Stick to this plan and we can break Ferrari. We have the best car, we are the best team, now show me you men are the best drivers.<br>
MILES Now I know how a spark plug feels... If this was a beauty pageant, we just lost [to Ferrari]. Looks fast. Doesn't it?<br>
SHELBY Looks ain't everything, Bulldog. You can take him.<br>
Miles ACCELERATES HARD working his way through the fastest and most deadly traffic jam in the world, out under--- ZOOM! -- The Dunlop Bridge - he realizes his door won't close. The wind whips in at 100mph. He swaps hands on the wheel to hold it, swapping hands awkwardly to change gear at top speed. As Miles struggles, Bandini comes up from behind and passes him.<br>
TANNOY Ferrari in 1st place, Ford in 2nd and 3rd.<br>
SHELBY Where the hell is Ken.<br>
CHARLIE He's coming in! HE'S COMING IN!<br>
HENRY FORD II What the hell is wrong?<br>
MILES (breathless) The bloody door won't close!<br>
IN THE FERRARI BOX. ENZO WATCHES, PLEASED, AS BELOW-- THE SHELBY MECHANICS struggle to fix the door. Remington wades in with a lump hammer and smashes it closed.<br>
REMINGTON Go! Go! Go!<br>
PETER He's back out.<br>
CHARLIE Shelby!<br>
SHELBY I know, Charlie, Ken's fallen back of Bandini.<br>
CHARLIE But Gurney's making a move on him!<br>
BEEBE What the hell? This is not the plan-<br>
SHELBY Plans change. He'll get in his slot and slow to pace.<br>
TANNOY Ken Miles in the Number 1 Ford has broken the lap record 3 minutes and 34 seconds.<br>
ABC'S CHARLIE BROCKMAN --the most amazing 24 hours ever here at Le Mans, a battle from the start at a most tremendous pace... Ford's Ken Miles lowers the record again to 3 minutes 31.9, that's an average speed of 142.01mph.<br>
PETER That's Dad. His fastest lap!<br>
MILES Happy Birthday old chap.<br>
SHELBY 3 seconds faster than Gurney. If you hadn't blown the start you'd be in the lead. Can you keep this up?<br>
MILES No idea.<br>
TANNOY There's been an accident. French entries no. 55 and 41 have collided- It appears No. 20 Ferrari of Ludo Scarfiotti has also left the track. All three drivers are alive.<br>
CHARLIE The Deuce is probably going to someplace fancy for dinner..<br>
REMINGTON What do you mean probably?<br>
SHELBY Rains' a'comin.<br>
MILES (watching) ...Easy, Dan.<br>
TANNOY Porsche #32 and an unidentified Ford are off the track at Arnage.<br>
BEEBE (arriving in the pit) What the hell is he doing?<br>
SHELBY What he came to do.<br>
SHELBY Something's wrong.<br>
ABC ANNOUNCER ..It looks like Ken Miles is bringing the Number 1 into the pits very slowly. Something's wrong!<br>
MILES (leaping out) Braking. Nothing at all. Gone. The car is too damned heavy! I had him. I almost had him.<br>
SHELBY He's putting another a lap on us now.<br>
PETER They're doing it! The brakes!<br>
OFFICIAL This is not legal..<br>
MILES Show me where it says it in the rule book that you can't swap out the system and you can disqualify us. Otherwise would you be so kind as to get the hell out of the way and let my team do its job.<br>
CHARLIE Bandini is pitting! He's pitting!<br>
MILES How long?<br>
SHELBY He stays in the pit another 15 seconds, we get you out, you can still take him. But you're gonna have to pass him twice for the lead, Bulldog.<br>
MILES I get it! Two laps! I get it! (getting in the car) Get me out of here, Pops!<br>
SHELBY (CONT'D) GO GO GO!<br>
REMINGTON This gonna work?<br>
Miles trailing him, testing his brakes on the T Turn, not confident yet. Bandini breaks away.<br>
REMINGTON He doesn't trust the car. Yet.<br>
MILES ENTERS THE MULSANNE. He opens it right up. The awesome power of the GT40 full bore. As he hits 220, 222, he pulls up behind Bandini. Racing towards them is the hairpin. The mile markers count down the distance. Bandini's confident. He knows the heavier GT40 must brake earlier because Miles needs more time to slow the GT. The Ferrari can brake later. The hairpin's racing towards them. Bandini doesn't brake. He's expecting Miles to brake. Miles doesn't brake. Bandini glances nervously expecting it. The hairpin is a 40 MPH turn. They're doing 223. Bandini's eyes flicker to Miles. Miles' face is set. Then he smiles. Is it nihilism? A game of chicken? Does Miles intend to crash both cars? Bandini blinks. Brakes first. Miles shoots past him. Then he slams on the brakes. The faster, heavier GT40's velocity battles friction. Wheels lock. Rubber burns. Tires scream. Miles feathers his braking a bit to keep the wheels from locking. The hairpin and destruction race at him. Miles wrestling to slow, half-skidding. Into the turn. GT40 slides sideways, the rear breaking loose to the right. And Miles is already on the gas while coming off the brakes... trail braking while accelerating through the turn...taking the lead. FERRARIS behind the GT40. Bandini, enraged, slams through the gears. Redlines. Shifts. Redlines. Shifts, trying to catch up but the GT is already in the distance.<br>
IN THE SHELBY PITS -- The crew cheer as Miles roars by, overtaking other cars.<br>
SHELBY He ain't done it yet! He needs another lap for the lead! (to Miles) Use the machine, Bulldog.<br>
PETER He needs to take another lap on him!<br>
Weaving through cars at breakneck speed, Miles sees Bandini in the distance. He pulls round the Tertre Rouge and alongside the red Ferrari. Miles' tachometer. A couple hundred RPM left in the power band. The GT40 inches ahead of Bandini's Ferrari. Determined, Bandini pushes the Ferrari on the straight. BANG. An explosion from the Ferrari. It falls back as if shot backwards from a cannon. Smoke and steam. Bandini blew the engine.<br> MILES MOVES INTO FIRST PLACE. Exhilaration as the realization dawns. Not that he's leading Le Mans. Not that he's leading the hardest race in the world. A smile grows. He's excelling. He turns into the sweep of a straight. The road almost clear of cars, dead and dying machines litter the edge. Not Ken Miles. He blows through a cloud of smoke.<br>
IN THE SHELBY AMERICAN PIT Shelby smiles as Miles streak past the pits.<br>
CHARLIE He did it! We're in lead! (looking to leaderboard) Are we in the lead?<br>
SHELBY (Re: forlorn Ferrari Pits) What about Bandini?<br>
REMINGTON Out. Done. Ferrari's over.<br>
CHARLIE (checks stats, astounded) McLaren's 4 minutes behind him in a GT. We're lying Ken first, and 2 and 3. All Fords. </p>

MILES Gonna be rain again tomorrow.<br>
SHELBY There's always rain here. But the start's gonna be dry. ..We'll change your tires come rain.<br>
MILES Yup yup.<br>
SHELBY Sleep might be smart, bulldog.<br>
MILES (mind racing) Yeah. You too.<br>
SHELBY I'm not driving.<br>
MILES True enough. ..ok.<br>
SHELBY Ken. You got nothing to prove. Not to anyone that matters.<br>

From Ford V Ferrari<br>
MILES Hey.. in bed you.<br>
PETER I drew it so I could follow you. Tell me about the track, Dad. Please-<br>
MILES Well. I guess we should start at the start line.<br>
PETER But here's the actual start, right, because you have to run to your car at Le Mans.<br>
MILES True enough. And once your old man manages to hobble over and pull out --<br>
PETER --and not hit anyone in the scrum--<br>
MILES -- then you have to accelerate, hard, up to Dunlop bridge, tricky bend, uphill camber of the road away from you. Then down through the trees to the Esses. Braking. Second gear. Accelerating up to Terte Rouge. Critical first gear corner. Fast entry. Keep speed for your exit onto Mulsanne. Long straight-away. Hemmed in by poplars. Top gear... 210mph. You relax on the straight. Refocus. Collect energy. Then bend down to third but keep the revs up. Try to get a maximum exit. Let the car run free. Over the brow which you can't help jump but can't damage the car, then.. wham.. the Mulsanne Corner. First gear. A hair pin. Lot of cars go into the sand. Oil and fuel on the track. Third and fourth through the Kinks to Indianapolis. Out of blinding sun into the darkness. More trees. Accelerate to Arnage, brake, another sandbank of dead cars. A beautiful winding top speed stretch. Over the rise to the White House. Past the pits through the grandstand over the line. Your first 3.5 minutes of 24 hours.<br>
PETER You can't make every lap perfect.<br>
MILES ...No. ...But I try.<br>
PETER But you can't. No one can do everything perfect every time.<br>
MILES Well... That's true.<br>
PETER ...Maybe that's why you get angry sometimes.<br>
MILES May be. Go to bed now, young man. I'll wake you up before I leave.

SHELBY Walt's taking her too fast...<br>
HOLMAN He's pushing 7000 RPM! Put the EZ sign out. Do it!<br>
SHELBY STILL RACING! WE ARE STILL RACING!<br>
MILES Hansgen's up our arse. Just hold position... Just hold position.<br>
SHELBY (to Hansgen in next pit) Good to see you, Walt.<br>
HANSGEN After I get out of this pit, Shelby, it's the last time you will.<br>
SHELBY Relax Walt. We got rearview mirrors.<br>
MILES What happened to the Mustang he took out?<br>
SHELBY No word.<br>
REPORTER Is it a relief that Scuderia Ferrari is not represented here this year?<br>
LEO BEEBE This is a test not just for our cars but also our Teams. As you know Ford has a second team competing today-<br>
PETER Ask him about the brakes!<br>
MOLLIE In bed. Now.<br>
MILES I take it he's not asleep.<br>
MOLLIE Well he's in his pajamas and the lights are off but I'm pretty certain he's smuggled in a radio.. He said to ask how are the brakes.<br>
MILES Working. For now. We'll see where we are in eight hours.<br>
MOLLIE Ken.<br>
MILES Ford put up another team with a GT. Some kind of test. I'm trying not to push the car but their pit's faster.<br>
MOLLIE --Ken.<br>
MILES Real test will be Le Mans. --what.<br>
MOLLIE Please get some rest while you have a chance. You got a few hours.<br>
PETER Ruby just got out of the pit...<br>
PETER (CONT'D) Is Dad alright?<br>
MOLLIE He's got a few hours to rest, Peter. So do we.<br>
LATER : DAYTONA RACEWAY. DAY. A drained Shelby watches the adjacent pit as the HOLMAN MOODY TEAM celebrates as the PA STATES THEY ARE IN THE LEAD. Leo Beebe is among them, patting backs.<br>
LLOYD RUBY We're locked out. There's nothing Miles can do. This late in the race, running hot, we gotta keep the engine under six thou.<br>
Shelby walks to the side of the pit. Agitated. He crosses, grabs a sign board and waves to the Marshall for the OK to cross the pit lane, then hops over the wall. As Miles approaches in the GT, Shelby scribbles on the board and holds it up high. MILES' POV -- SHELBY HOLDING OUT THE RACE BOARD: 7000+. GO LIKE HELL.<br>
Miles laughs, drops a gear and floors it.<br>
REMINGTON She could come apart.<br>
SHELBY One way to find out.<br>
REMINGTON Miles is pushing him. Hard.<br>
CHARLIE White flag! Last lap!<br>
SHELBY Hansgen's gonna crack.<br>
HANSGEN SEES MILES in his rearview and the two dog fight around the banked track. MILES slipstreams and slides past him on the high side.<br>
BEEBE What the hell...<br>
Engine roaring, crowd screaming, Miles swerves past other vehicles, scorching across the line. A flicker of A CHECKERED FLAG as he streaks past. Hansgen takes 3rd behind Gurney. Pounds his dash. SHELBY AND THE FILTHY PIT TEAM GO WILD IN CELEBRATION. People converge on Miles' car, among them Remington and Shelby rapping on the glass.<br>
ON LEO BEEBE IN THE BOXES. Ford execs slap Beebe on the back. He tries to hide his dismay. Reaches for a phone. INT. FORD CONFERENCE ROOM.<br>
HENRY FORD II Uh huh. (looks up to the others in conference room) We won. Ford won Daytona! And which team was it, Leo? (beat) Leo. I understand it was a Ford Team, which Ford team? (listens) ...Son of a bitch.

From Pachinko by Min Jin Lee<br>
Acknowledgments: I got the idea for the story in 1989. (The book came out in 2018).<br>
I was a junior in college, and I didn't know what I'd do after graduation. Rather than ponder my future, I sought distractions. One afternoon, I attended what was then called a Master's Tea, a guest lecture series at Yale. I'd never been to one before.<br>
...The missionary talked about this history and relayed a story of a middle school boy who was bullied in his yearbook because of his Korean background. The boy jumped off a building and died. I would not forget this.<br>
...Then in 2007, my husband got a job offer in Tokyo, and we moved there in August. On the ground, I had the chance to interview dozens of Koreans in Japan and learned that I'd gotten the story wrong. The Korean Japanese may have been historical victims, but when I met them in person, none of them were as simple as that. I was so humbled by the beradth and complexity of the people I met in Japan that I put aside my old draft and started to write the book again in 2008, and I continued to write it and revise it until its publication.<br>
I have had this story with me for almost thirty years. Conswquently, there are many people to thank.<br>
Speer Morgan and Evelyn Somers of The Missouri Review believed in this story first. The NYFA gave me a fiction fellowship when I wanted to give up. Thank you.<br>
...I want to thank my friends and family in Japan, South Korea, and the United states for their love, faith, and kindness.<br>
...My early readers... gave me their invaluable time, keen insights, and the necessary courage to persevere. Thank you.<br>
In 2006, I met my agent Suzanne Gluck, and I remain deeply grateful for her friendship, wisdom, and goodness... I am thankful to Clio Seraphim for her thoughtful support.<br>
Here I declare my profound gratitude to my amazing editor Deb Futter, whose clear-eyed vision, superb intelligence, and exceptional care shaped this book... As ever, many thanks to the wonderful Andy Dodds, whose passion and excellence inspire me.<br>
Mom, Dad, Myung, and Sang: thank you for your love. Christopher and Sam: You fill my life with wonder and grace. Thank you for being my family.

From Pachinko by Min Jin Lee<br>
Sunja(crying): All time, you see people cry.<br>
Cemetary groundskeeper: No, actually, very few people come here, but your family visits regularly. You have two sons and a grandson, Solomon. Mozasu-sama(Sunja's son) visits every month or two. I haven't seen Noa-sama(Sunja's other son) in eleven years, but he used to come on the last Thursday of each month. You could set a watch to him. How is Noa-sama? He was a very kind man.<br>
Sunja: Noa come here? Come before 1978?<br>
Groundskeeper: Hai.<br>
Sunja: From 1963 to 1978? He visit here?<br>
Groundskeeper: Hai, hai. He came in those years and before, too. Noa-sama told me to go to school and even offered to send me if I wished.<br>
Sunja: Really?<br>
Groundskeeper: Yes, but I told him I have an empty gourd for a head, and that it would have been pointless to send me to school. Besides, I like it here. It's quiet. Everybody who comes to visit is very kind. [Noa] asked me never to mention his visits, but I have not seen him in over a decade... He told me to read good books and brought me translations of the great British author Charles Dickens.<br>
Sunja: Noa, my son, is dead... My son, my son.<br>
Groundskeeper: I am very sad to hear that, Boku-san. Truly, I am. I'd been hoping to tell him that after I finished all the books he'd brought me, I bought more of my own. I have read through all of Mr. Dickens's books in translations, but my favorite is the first one he gave me, David Copperfield. I admire David.<br>
Sunja: Noa loved to read. The best. He loved to read.<br>
Groundskeeper: Have you read Mr. Dickens?<br>
Sunja: I don't know how. To read.<br>
Groundskeeper: Maji? If you are Noa's mother, you are very smart, too. Perhaps you can go to night school for adults. That is what Noa-sama told me to do.<br>
Sunja smiled at the groundskeeper, who seemed hopeful about sending an old woman to school. She remembered Noa cajoling Mozasu to persevere with his studies.<br>
The groundskeeper looked at his rake. He bowed deeply, then excused himself to return to his tasks.<br>
When he was out of sight, Sunja dug a hole at the base of the tombstone about a foot deep with her hands and dropped the key ring photograph inside. She covered the hole with dirt and grass, then did what she could to clean her hands with her handkerchief, but dirt remained beneath her nails. Sunja tamped down the earth, then brushed the grass with her fingers.<br>
She picked up her bags. Kyunghee would be waiting for her at home.

They missed their old rituals, so [Sunja] went to the cemetery regularly. It was curious, but Sunja felt close to Isak(her deceased husband) in a way that she hadn't when he was alive. Then she had been in awe of him and his goodness. Dead, he seemed more approachable to her.<br>
...Lately, every time [Sunja] went to the cemetery, she wondered what Isak would have thought of Noa's[Sunja's son] death. Isak would have understood Noa's suffering. He would have known what to say to him... Sorry, Noa, sorry. It had been eleven years since [Noa had] died; the pain didn't go away, but its sharp edge had dulled and softened like sea glass.<br>
...In [Sunja's] dreams, [Hansu] was as vibrant as he had been when she was a girl. It was not Hansu that she missed, or even Isak. What she was seeing again in her dreams was her youth, her beginning, and her wishes--so this was how she became a woman. Without Hansu and Isak and Noa, there wouldn't have been this pilgrimage to this land. Beyond the dailiness, there had been moments of shimmering beauty and some glory, too, even in this ajumma's life. Even if no one knew, it was true.<br>
There was consolation: The people you loved, they were always there with you, she had learned. Sometimes, she could be in front of a train kiosk or the window of a bookstore, and she could feel Noa's small hand when he was a boy, and she would close her eyes and think of his sweet, grassy smell and remember that he had always tried his best. At those moments, it was good to be alone to hold on to him.

Solomon: I can't marry [Phoebe]. And I told her that I'd rather live in Japan. Work in pachinko.<br>
Mozasu: What? Pachinko? No, no. You'll get another job in banking. That's why you went to Columbia, nee?... She's a nice girl. I thought you'd get married... Pachinko? Honto?<br>
Solomon: Yeah, why not?<br>
Mozasu: You don't want to do this. You don't know what people say.<br>
Solomon: None of that stuff is true. You're an honest business person. I know you pay your taxes and get all your licenses, and--<br>
Mozasu: Yes, yes, I do. But people will always say things. They will always say terrible things, no matter what. It's normal for me. I'm nobody. There's no need for you to do this work. I wasn't smart at school like my brother. I was good at running around and fixing things. I was good at making money. I've always kept my business clean and stayed away from the bad things. Goro-san taught me that it's not worth it to get involved with the bad guys. But Solomon, this business is not easy, nee? It's not just tinkering with machines and ordering new ones and hiring people to work on the floor. There are so many things that can go wrong. We know lots of people who went belly-up, nee?<br>
Solomon: Why don't you want me to do this?<br>
Mozasu: I sent you to those American schools so that no one would-- no one is going to look down at my son.<br>
Solomon: Papa, it doesn't matter. None of it matters, nee?<br>
Mozasu: I worked and made money because I thought it would make me a man. I thought people would respect me if I was rich.<br>
Solomon looked at him and nodded. His father rarely spent on himself, but he had paid for weddings and funerals for employees and sent tuition for their children.<br>
Mozasu: You can change your mind, Solomon. You can call Phoebe when she gets home and say you're sorry. Your mother was a lot like Phoebe--strong-willed and smart.<br>
Solomon: I want to live here. She will not.<br>
Mozasu: Soo nee.<br>
Solomon picked up the ledger from his father's table.<br>
"Explain this to me, Papa."<br>
Mozasu paused, then he opened the book.

From Pachinko by Min Jin Lee<br>
Phoebe: I never liked [Kazu, Solomon's former boss]. Too smooth.<br>
Solomon: Well, I'm obviously an idiot, because I did. Besides, how in the world did you get that impression of Kazu in the little time you had? You met him for about two minutes when we ran into him at Mitsukoshi. And you've never mentioned this before... I actually liked him.<br>
Phoebe: Solomon, that guy screwed you. He's a dick.<br>
Solomon: I feel much better now.<br>
Phoebe: I'm on your team.<br>
Phoebe didn't know if she should get up and sit by him. She didn't want him to think that she felt sorry for him. Her older sister used to say that men hated pity; rather, they wanted sympathy and admiration--not an easy combination.<br>
Phoebe: He was a phony. He talked to you like you were his little buddy. Like he's some big man on campus and you're one of his 'boys.' Does that system still even exist? I hate that frat-boy brother shit.<br>
Solomon was dumbstruck. She had managed to encapsulate his entire relationship with Kazu from that brief, almost nonexistent encounter at the food court of the Mitsukoshi department store. How had she done this?<br>
Solomon: You don't like him because he's Japanese.<br>
Phoebe: Don't get mad at me. It's not that I distrust the Japanese, but I don't know if I trust them entirely. You're going to say that I've been reading too much about the Pacific War. I know, I know, I sound a little bigoted.<br>
Solomon: A little? The Japanese have suffered, too. Nagasaki? Hiroshima? And in America, the Japanese Americans were sent to interment camps, but the German Americans weren't. How do you explain that?<br>
...Solomon: Hey, what are you doing?<br>
Hana: I'm going home.<br>
Solomon: Don't be like that.<br>
Hana: Well, it occurs to me that I lost my life when I came here with you, and you're not worth it.<br>
What could he say? He wouldn't marry her. He had known it almost as soon as they'd landed in Narita. Her confidence and self-possession had mesmerized him in college. Her equanimity, which had seemed so important in the States, seemed like aloofness and arrogance in Tokyo. She had lost her life here, this was true, but marrying her didn't seem like a solution.<br>
Then the whole Japan-is-evil stuff. Sure there were assholes in Japan, but there were assholes everywhere, nee? Ever since they got here, either she had changed or his feelings for her had changed. Hadn't he been leaning toward asking her to marry him? Yet now, when she put forward the idea of marrying for citizenship, he realized that he didn't want to become an American. It made sense for him to do so; it would have made his father happy. Was it better to be an American than a Japanese? He knew Koreans who had become naturalized Japanese, and it made sense to do so, but he didn't want to do that now, either. Maybe one day. She was right; it was weird that he was born in Japan and had a South Korean passport. He couldn't rule out getting naturalized. Maybe another Korean wouldn't understand that, but he didn't care anymore.<br>
Kazu was a shit, but so what? He was one bad guy, and he was Japanese. Perhaps that was what going to school in America had taught him. Even if there were a hundred bad Japanese, if there was one good one, he refused to make a blanket statement. Etsuko was like a mother to him; his first love was Hana; and Totoyama was like an uncle, too. They were Japanese, and they were very good. She hadn't known them the way he had; how could he expect her to understand?<br>
In a way, Solomon was Japanese, too, even if the Japanese didn't think so. Phoebe couldn't see this. There was more to being something than just blood. The space between Phoebe and him could not close, and if he was decent, he had to let her go home.<br>
...Hana: I have never felt so stupid in my life. Why am I here?<br>
Solomon stared at her, not knowing how to comfort her. He was afraid of her; perhaps he had always been afraid of her--her joy, anger, sadness, excitement--she had so many extreme feelings... Back in New York, she had been spirited and wonderful. Here, Phoebe was almost too stark, awkward.<br>
...Solomon: I think I'm going to work for my dad.<br>
Hana: Pachinko?<br>
Solomon: Yeah.<br>
Hana: He asked you?<br>
Solomon: No. I don't think he wants me to. Maybe I can take over the business.<br>
Hana: You're kidding, right?<br>
Solomon: No.<br>
...Hana: Pachinko. Well, that makes it easier then. I can't live here, Solomon. Even if you wanted to marry me, I can't live here. I can't breathe here.<br>
Solomon: That first night we arrived, when you couldn't read the instructions on the aspirin bottle, and you started to cry. I should have known then... You have to dump me.<br>
Hana: Yes, I do.<br>
She left in the morning.

Hana: You should take over your father's business.<br>
Solomon: Pachinko?<br>
Hana: Yes, pachinko. Why not? All these idiots who say bad things about it are jealous. Your father is an honest person. He could be richer if he was crooked, but he's rich enough. Goro is a good guy, too. He might be a yak, but who cares? I don't. And if he isn't, I'm sure he knows them all. It's a filthy world, Solomon. No one is clean. Living makes you dirty. I've met plenty of fancy people from IBJ and BOJ who are from the best families, and they like to do some sick shit in bed. A lot of them do very bad things in business, but they don't get caught. Most of the ones I've fucked would steal if they had the chance. They're too scared to have any real ambition. Listen, Solomon, nothing will ever change here. Do you see that?<br>
Solomon: What do you mean?<br>
Hana: You're a fool, but you are my fool.... Japan will never change. It will never ever integrate gaijin, and my darling, here you will always be a gaijin and never Japanese. Nee? The zainichi can't leave, nee? But it's not just you. Japan will never take people like mother back into society again; it will never take back people like me. And we're Japanese! I'm diseased. I got this from some Japanese guy who owned an old trading company. He's dead now. But nobody cares. The doctors here, even, they just want me to go away. So listen, Solomon, you should stay here and not go back to the States, and you should take over your papa's business. Become so rich that you can do whatever you want. But, my beautiful Solomon, they're never going to think we're okay. Do you know what I mean? Do what I tell you to do.<br>
Solomon: My own father doesn't want that. Even Goro-san sold his parlors and is doing real estate now. Papa wanted me to work in an American investment bank.<br>
Hana: What, so you can be like Kazu? I know a thousand Kazus. They're not fit to wipe your father's ass.<br>
Solomon: There are good people in the banks, too.<br>
Hana: And there are good people in pachinko, too. Like your father... Your grandmother Sunja and great-aunt Kyunghee visit me on Saturdays. Did you know that? They pray for me, too. I don't understand the Jesus stuff, but it's something holy to have people touch you when you're sick. The nurses here are afraid to touch me. Your grandmother Sunja holds my hands, and your great-aunt Kyunghee puts cool towels on my head when I get too hot. They're kind to me, though I'm a bad person--<br>
Solomon: You're not bad. That's not true.<br>
Hana: I've done terrible things. Solomon, when I was a hostess, I sold drugs to one girl who ended up overdosing, I stole money from a lot of men. I've told so many lies... I deserve this.<br>
Solomon: No. It's a virus. Everybody gets sick.<br>
Hana: That's okay, Solomon. I'm not doing bad things anymore. I've had time to think about my stupid life.

From Min Jin Lee<br>
I talked to these wall street investment bankers and I thought, you are so boring. You cannot carry a long novel. You can definitely carry two to three chapters... I think about this alot. I think about how things should be interesting. The people that I want you to meet should be interesting. And very often what I realized was that it wasn't that those characters, the people that I interviewed weren't interesting, it's that they had such incredible polish and grooming that they had lost something of a rawness. And I needed to figure out, why did you lose your rawness? Who told you that you couldn't have it anymore? And I think in these kinds of environments where we're very elite and polished and successful, it's really scary to cry and to be upset and to have troubles. To say I don't have money or that I don't have access or that I got rejected. Those things make people really nervous. Aren't we supposed to be having a good time? When I met these "successful" people, they were unwilling to talk about what really was upsetting them. I realized they are this way because they've had to carry so much of the pain of the other generations.

Min: I definitely think that all of us suffer from the untold stories in our families. And I think sometimes you can even look at people acting out because there's some secret two generations ago. I really believe in all of that stuff about intergenerational trauma being carried down in our cells.<br>
Claire Messud: With mice, they were terrified of cherry blossoms and 3 generations later the mice were terrified of the scent of cherry blossoms.
Min: And I think there's a part of us that has these questions. Why am I afraid of this? Why does this upset me? And it's not that every child that you have is going to be upset by it. But you will have one child somewhere in the family who really wants to know.

Solomon: I wanted to see you. And you are lovely, Hana. That will never change.<br>
[Solomon] could not imagine [Hana] dying. He wanted to pick her up and spirit her away to New York. In America, everything seemed fixable, and in Japan, difficult problems were to be endured. Sho ga nai, sho ga nai. How many times had he heard these words? It cannot be helped. His mother had apparently hated that expression, and suddenly he understood her rage against this cultural resignation that violated her beliefs and wishes.<br>
Hana: Oh, Solomon. I don't want to go to America. I don't want to live. I'm ready to die... I've wanted to die for so many years, but I was too cowardly to say it or to do anything to make my wish come true... Everyone wants to die sometimes, nee?<br>
Solomon: That spring. When you left. I wanted to die.<br>
Hana: If I had stayed, we would've loved each other too much, and I felt certain that I would hurt you. You see, I'm not a good person, and you are a good person. You shouldn't be with me. It's simple... You're the only person I have never ever wanted to hurt.

Mozasu: Does Phoebe want to live in Japan?<br>
Solomon: Not sure. She hates that she doesn't know Japanese.<br>
Mozasu: She can learn.<br>
Solomon: She wants to work. It's not easy to get your career going straight out of college in Japan. And she doesn't have the language skills. Staying home is not good for Phoebe.<br>
Mozasu nodded. Solomon's mother had been the same way.<br>
...Solomon: Why don't you sell the shops, too, Dad? Retire maybe. You're set, right? Pachinko is a lot of work.<br>
Mozasu: What? Quit the business? Pachinko put food on the table and sent you to school. I'm too young to retire!... And what would happen if I sell my stores? They might fire my workers. And where would my older workers go? And we give work to the people who make the machines. Pachinko's a bigger business in Japan than car manufacturing.<br>
Solomon nodded and stared at the screen, trying to pay attention to the currency news. His father didn't seem the least bit embarrassed by what he did for a living.

From Pachinko by Min Jin Lee<br>
Phoebe: [My mom] never learned [how to cook Korean food]. And none of [my mom's] sisters cook Korean food, either.<br>
Phoebe laughed, because the fact that none of them cooked Korean food was a point of pride. Her mother and her sisters tended to look down at women who cooked a lot and constantly tried to make you eat. The four of them were very thin. Like Phoebe, they were the kind of women who were constantly moving around and seemed uninterested in eating because they were so absorbed in their work...<br>
Phoebe found it amusing to see their continuing shock and disbelief at such a mundane detail of her childhood. What was the big deal? Why did women have to cook, anyway? she wondered. Her mother was her favorite person in the world... I have aunts and uncles by marriage who are white, black, Dutch, Jewish, Filipino, Mexican, Chinese, Puerto Rican, and, let's see, there's one Korean American uncle and three Korean American aunts.<br>
...If [Phoebe] didn't cook, then so what? If [Phoebe] took good care of Solomon, then onthing else should matter, though she hoped that Phoebe wanted children.
	</p>

	<p id="843">
From Pachinko by Min Jin Lee<br>
Whenever Phoebe said Japanese people were racist, Solomon would bring up Etsuko and Kazu as personal evidence for his argument to the contrary. Etsuko was the obvious example of a Japanese person who was kindhearted and ethnically unbiased, but Phoebe barely understood her, since Etsuko's English was terrible. Kazu[Solomon's boss] was Japanese, and he had been far kinder to Solomon than most Koreans in Japan who had occasionally eyed him with suspicion as a wealthy man's son or as competition at school. Yes, some Japanese thought Koreans were scum, but some Koreans were scum, he told Phoebe. Some Japanese were scum, too. There was no need to keep rehashing the past; he hoped Phoebe would get over it eventually.<br>
...Kazu: Listen, there is a tax, you know, on success... If you do well at anything, you gotta pay up to all the people who did worse. On the other hand, if you do badly, life makes you pay a shit tax, too. Everybody pays something... Of course, the worst one is the tax on the mediocre. Now, that one's a bitch. Pay attention: The ones who pay the shit tax are mostly people who were born in the wrong place and the wrong time and are hanging on to the planet by their broken fingernails. They don't even know the fucking rules of the game. You can't even get mad at 'em when they lose. Life just fucks and fucks and fucks bastards like that. So, those losers have to climb Mount Everest to get out of hell, and maybe one or two in five hundred thousand break out, but the rest pay the shit tax all their lives, then they die. If God exists and if He's fair, then it makes sense that in the afterlife, those guys should get the better seats... But all those able-bodied middle-class people who are scared of their shadows, well, they pay the mediocre tax in regular quarterly installments with compounding interest. When you play it safe, that's what happens, my friend. So if I were you, I wouldn't throw any games. I'd use every fucking advantage. Beat anyone who fucks with you to a fucking pulp. Show no mercy to chumps, especially if they don't deserve it. Make the pussies cry.<br>
Solomon: So then the success tax comes from envy, and the shit tax comes from exploitation. Okay. Then what's the mediocre tax? How can it be wrong to--?<br>
Kazu: Good question, young jedi. The tax for being mediocre comes from you and everyone else knowing that you are mediocre. It's a heavier tax than you'd think.<br>
Solomon had never thought of such a thing before. It wasn't like he saw himself as terribly special, but he'd never seen himself as mediocre, either. Perhaps it was unspoken, even to himself, but he did want to be good at something.
Kazu: Jedi, understand this: There's nothing fucking worse than knowing that you're just like everybody else. What a messed-up, lousy existence. And in this great country of Japan--the birthplace of all my fancy ancestors--everyone, everyone wants to be like everyone else. That's why it is such a safe place to live, but it's also a dinosaur village. It's extinct, pal. Carve up your piece and invest your spoils elsewhere. You're a young man, and someone should tell you the real truth about this country. Japan is not fucked because it lost the war or did bad things. Japan is fucked because there is no more war, and in peacetime everyone actually wants to be mediocre and is terrified of being different. The other thing is that the elite Japanese want to be English and white. That's pathetic, delusional, and merits another discussion entirely.<br>
Solomon thought some of this made sense. Everyone he knew who was really Japanese did think he was middle-class even when he wasn't. Rich kids at his high school... thought of themselves as middle-class. His uncle Noa, whom he'd never met, had apparently killed himself because he wanted to be Japanese and normal.<br>
...Solomon: My father's never taken anything that wasn't his; he doesn't even care about money. He gives away so much of it--<br>
...Kazu: ... there's no need to explain. It's not like Koreans had a lot of choices in regular professions. I'm sure he chose pachinko because there wasn't much else. He's probably an excellent businessman. You think your poker skills came out of a vacuum? Maybe your dad could have worked for Fuji or Sony, but it wasn't like they were going to hire a Korean, right? I doubt they'd hire you now, Mr. Coloumbia University. Japan still doesn't hire Koreans to be teachers, cops, and nurses in lots of places. You couldn't even rent your own apartment in Tokyo, and you make good money. It's fucking 1989! Anyway, you can be polite about it, but that's fucked up. I'm Japanese but I'm not stupid. I lived in America and Europe for a long time; it's crazy what the Japanese have done to the Koreans and the Chinese who were born here. It's fucking bonkers; you people should have a revolution. You don't protest enough. You and your dad were born here, right?... Even if your dad was a hit man, I wouldn't give a shit. And I wouldn't turn him in.<br>
Solomon: But he's not.<br>
Kazu: No, kid, of course he's not. Go home to your girlfriend. I heard she's a looker and smart. That's good. Because in the end, brains matter more than you think.<br>
Kazu hailed a taxi and told Solomon to take it before him. Everyone said that Kazu wasn't like regular bosses, and it was true.<br>
...Kazu: So this is where Sonoko Matsuda lives. The client is confident that I can get Matsuda-san to sell.<br>
Solomon: Can you?<br>
Kazu: I think so, but I don't know how.<br>
Solomon: This will sound stupid, but how can you get her to sign if you don't know how?<br>
Kazu: I'm making a wish, Solly. I'm making a wish. Sometimes, that's how it starts.

Hana: Yes, but at another club. You don't know which one. I am an excellent hostess.<br>
Solomon: I'm sure you would be excellent at whatever you decide to do.<br>
... Solomon closed his eyes. She was right; this felt like hunger. It had been nothing short of physical pain when she had left him, and he'd had no words to describe her departure. He loved Phoebe, but it wasn't what he'd felt for Hana.<br>
...Etsuko stood there, believing that if she coudl just listen and suffer, then maybe her daughter could be saved.

Sunja stared at [Hansu]. In the moments before her death, her mother had said that this man had ruined her life, but had he? He had given her Noa; unless she had been pregnant, she wouldn't have married Isak, and without Isak, she wouldn't have had Mozasu and now her grandson Solomon. She didn't want to hate him anymore. What did Joseph say to his brothers who had sold him into slavery when he saw them again? "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives." This was something Isak had taught her when she'd asked him about the evil of this world.

From Pachinko by Min Jin Lee<br>
Strangely, as Yangjin's limbs and joints quit, one after the other, and as her muscles softened into jelly, her mind felt clearer and more free. She could imagine leaving her body to run swiftly like a deer. Yet in life, she could hardly move at all; she could barely eat anything recognizable as food... Her job was to rest before dying. All she had to do was nothing at all. At best, she had a few days left.<br>
Yangjin: A woman's lot is to suffer.<br>
... All her life, Sunja had heard this sentiment from other women, that they must suffer--suffer as a girl, suffer as a wife, suffer as a mother--die suffering. Go-saeng--the word made her sick. what else was there besides this? She had suffered to create a better life for Noa, and yet it was not enough. Should she have taught her son to suffer the humiliation that she'd drunk like water? In the end, he had refused to suffer the conditions of his birth. Did mothers fail by not telling their sons that suffering would come?<br>
Yangjin: You brought shame on [Noa] by having that man as his father. You caused your own suffering. Noa, that poor boy, came from a bad seed. You're fortunate that Isak married you. What a blessing that man was. Mozasu came from better blood. That's why he's so blessed in his work.<br>
...Sunja: Umma, you should go to sleep. We're going to leave you to rest...<br>
Yangjin: I'm not tired! You're going to leave again, are you? When things get difficult, it's easy to leave. Fine. I'll die now, then you won't have to stay here, and you can rush back to your precious Mozasu! I never created a burden for you one single day of my life. Until I couldn't move, every minute I have been here, I have worked to support myself. I never took a yen above what I needed to eat and to put a roof over our heads. I always held up my share, you know. I raised you when your kindhearted father died.<br>
...[Sunja's] mother was unrecognizable to her; it would have been easy to say that the illness had changed her, but it wasn't so simple, was it? Illness and dying had revealed her mother's truer thoughts, the ones her mother had been protecting her from. Sunja had made a mistake; however, she didn't believe that her son came from a bad seed. The Japanese said that Koreans had too much anger and heat in their blood. Seeds, blood. How could you fight such hopeless ideas? Noa had been a sensitive child who had believed that if he followed all hte rules and was the best, then somehow the hostile world would change its mind. His death may have been her fault for having allowed him to believe in such cruel ideas.<br>
Sunja: I'm sorry, umma. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I was away. I'm sorry about everything.<br>
The old woman looked weakly at her only child, hating herself suddenly. Yangjin wanted to say she was sorry, too, but strength passed from her body, forcing her to close her eyes.

Mozasu: [Yumi, my deceased ex-wife] was like my father and uncle, I think. Proud. She was proud of me and my work. It was nice. But now that I'm older, I wonder why. What do we Koreans have to be so proud of?<br>
Etsuko: It's good to be proud of your children.<br>
Why did [Etsuko's] family think pachinko was so terrible? Her father, a traveling salesman, had sold expensive life insurance policies to isolated housewives who couldn't afford them, and Mozasu created spaces where grown men and women could play pinball for money. Both men had made money from chance and fear and loneliness. Every morning, Mozasu and his men tinkered with the machines to fix the outcomes--there could only be a few winners and a lot of losers. And yet we played on, because we had hope that we might be the lucky ones. How could you get angry at the ones who wanted to be in the game? Etsuko had failed in this important way--she had not taught her children to hope, to believe in the perhaps-absurd possibility that they might win. Pachinko was a foolish game, but life was not.<br>
...Solomon: Yup. Hana seems great.<br>
Etsuko: My children hate me.<br>
Solomon: Your kids hate you because you're gone. They can't help it. They miss you.<br>
...Etsuko: I'm just so sorry that you might have thought that I didn't want to be your mother. I've hurt so many people. And you're such a good boy, Solomon. I wish I could take credit for you.<br>
Solomon: But I was born today, and isn't it funny how no one gets to remember that moment and who was there? It's all what's told to you. You're here now. You are a mother to me.

Etsuko: Hana, [Mozasu's] not--<br>
Hana: Your boyfriend's son doesn't seem like a brat.<br>
Etsuko: He doesn't have it easy.<br>
Hana: Not easy? American private schools, millions in the bank, and a chauffeur. Get some perspective, Mother.<br>
Etsuko: Today, he had to go to the ward office to request permission to stay in Japan for another three years. If he was denied, he could have been deported. He has to carry around an alien registration card and--<br>
Hana: Oh, really? But he wasn't deported, right? Now he gets a fancy party that's nicer than most weddings.<br>
Etsuko: He was born in this country, and he had to be fingerprinted today on his birthday like he was a criminal. He's just a child. He didn't do anything wrong.<br>

How can you tell me how hard it is to have children? You haven't even tried to be a mother. What right do you have? What makes you a mother?<br>
Etsuko grew silent, utterly transfixed by the realization that how she saw herself was actually how her children saw her, too. They thought she was a monster.<br>
Etsuko: How can you think that I didn't want the three of you?<br>
Being a mother was what defined her more than any other thing--more than being a daughter, wife, divorced woman, girlfriend, or restaurant owner. She hadn't done it well, but it was who she was, and it was what had changed her inside forever. From the moment Tatsuo was born, she had been filled with grief and self-doubt because she was never good enough. Even though she had failed, being a mother was eternal; a part of her life wouldn't end with her death.<br>
...When [Etsuko] had been a young mother there used to be only one time in her waking hours when she'd felt a kind of peace, and that was always after her children went to bed for the night. She longed to see her sons as they were back then: their legs chubby and white, their mushroom haircuts misshapen because they could never sit still at the barber. She wished she could take back the times she had scolded her children just because she was tired. There were so many errors. If life allowed revisions, she would let them stay in their bath a little longer, read them one more story before bed, and fix them another plate of shrimp.

Japanese clerk at immigration office: Your name-- So-ro-mo-n. What kind of name is that?<br>
Soromon: It's from the Bible. He was a king. The son of King David. A man of great wisdom. My great-uncle named me.<br>
The boy smiled at the clerk as if he was sharing a secret. He was a polite boy, but because he had gone to school with Americans and other kinds of foreigners at his international schools, he sometimes said things that a Japanese person would never have said.<br>
...Mozasu: Excuse me, sir. We're in a hurry to return home, because it's the boy's birthday. Is there anything else we should do? Thank you very much for understanding.<br>
...The clerk pointed to the back of the room and told Mozasu and Etsuko to sit.<br>
Etsuko: You must have known. You must have warned [Solomon]. I mean, you told him that today would not be so easy?<br>
Mozasu: No. I didn't say anything to him. I came here with my mother and brother, Noa, for my first registration papers. The clerk was normal. Nice even. So I asked you to come. I thought maybe having a woman by him might help. It was stupid to wish for kindness... It is hopeless. I cannot change [Solomon's, his son's] fate. He is Korean. He has to get those papers, and he has to follow all the steps of the lawperfectly. Once, at a ward office, a clerk told me that I was a guest in his country.<br>
Etsuko: You and Solomon were born here.<br>
Mozasu: Yes, my brother, Noa, was born here, too. And now he is dead... Anyway, the clerk was not wrong. And this is something Solmon must understand. We can be deported. We have no motherland. Life is full of things he cannot control so he must adapt. My boy has to survive...<br>
The clerk smiled at the boy and told him to pick up the registration card in the next room.<br>
Mozasu: Let's get your dog tags.<br>
Solomon: Hmm?<br>
Mozasu: It's what we dogs must have.<br>
Clerk: The fingerprints and registration cards are vitally important for government records. There's no need to feel insulted by this. It is an immigration regulation required for foreign--<br>
Etsuko: But you don't make your children get fingerprinted on their birthday, do you?<br>
Clerk: My son is dead.<br>
Etsuko bit her lip. She didn't want to feel anything for the woman, but she knew what it was like to lose your children--it was like you were cursed and nothing would ever restore the desolation of your life.<br>
Etsuko: Koreans do lots of good for this country. They do the difficult jobs Japanese don't want to do; they pay taxes, obey laws, raise good families, and create jobs.<br>
Clerk: You Koreans always tell me that.<br>
Mozasu: She's not Korean. [Etsuko is Japanese].<br>
...In life, there was so much insult and injury, and she had no choice but to collect what was hers. But now she wished to take Solomon's shame, too, and add it to her pile, though she was already overwhelmed.

From Pachinko by Min Jin Lee<br>
Etsuko: Where are you?<br>
Hana (Etsuko's 15 year old daughter): I'm four months pregnant.<br>
Etsuko: Nani?<br>
...This was her unmei, Etsuko thought; her ex-husband used to dismiss this idea of fate as a lazy explanation for the bad choices people made. Regardless, life had only confirmed her belief that there was indeed a pattern to it all. To Etsuko, this had to happen, because as a girl she had been no different. When she was seventeen, she had been pregnant with Tastuo, Hana's oldest brother.<br>
... The spring before [Etsuko's] thirty-sixth birthday, when she was still married and living Hokkaido, Etsuko had seduced another one of her high school boyfriends. She had been having a series of affairs for lmost three years with vaarious men from her adolescence. What amazed her was how difficult it was the first time but how effortless it was to have all the others that followed...<br>
[Etsuko's] complaint about her husband was not that he was boring or that he wasn't home enough. Nori was not a bad person. It was just tha she felt like she had no clear sense of him after nineteen years of marriage, and she doubted that she ever would. He didn't seem to need her except to be a wife in name and a mother to his children. For Nori, this was enough.<br>
There was no good excuse for her behavior. She knew that. But at night, when Nori[her husband] sat at the kitchen table to eat the dinner that had gotten cold because he'd come home late once again from another company gathering, she waited for something to come, some insight, some feeling. As she watched him with his eyes locked to his rice bowl, she wanted to shake him, because in all her life she had never expected this kind of loneliness. Around that time, someone had handed her a cult pamplet as she came out of the grocery store. On the flimsy cover, a middle-aged housewife was pictured as half skeleton and half flesh. On the bottom of the page it said, "Every day you are closer to your death. You are half-dead already. Where does your identity come from?" She tossed the pamplet away almost as soon as she got it, but the picture stayed with her for a long while.<br>
The last time she saw the playboy, he gave her a sheaf of poems that he had written for her... She couldn't say if they were good or not, but she was pleased by them. Etsuko privately marveled at the effort they must have taken, and she reasoned that in his showy way, he did love her. Finally, this one affair had given her what she had wanted from all the others--an assurance that whatever she had handed out so freely in her youth had neither died nor disappeared.<br>
...One sad thing seemed clear to [Etsuko]: If she needed all the men who had ever loved her to continue loving her, she would always be divided. She would always cheat, and she'd never be a good person. It dawned on her then that being a good person was something she had not given up on completely after all... In the morning, she told the playboy not to call her anymore, and he didn't.<br>
...Etsuko wanted to believe that being with Mozasu was changing her. That she was sexually faithful to him, she took as proof. She had once tried to explain this to her sister, and Mari had replied, "A snake that sheds its skin is still a snake." And her mother, on hearing that Mozasu wanted to marry her, said, "Honto? To a pachinko Korean? Haven't you done enough to your poor children? Why not just kill them?"<br>
...Etsuko held the watch case in her hands and wondered how they'd[Etsuko and Mozasu] stayed together with him not giving up and her not giving in.

Hansu: [Noa] always eats lunch by himself... He will read a little of his English novel, then return to his office. This is why he is so successful, I think. He does not make mistakes. Noa has a plan.<br>
Sunja: Do you think he'll see me?<br>
Hansu: It's hard to tell. You should wait in the car and get a glimpse of him, then the driver will take us back to Yokohama. We can return next week if you like. Maybe you can write to him first.<br>
Sunja: What's the difference between today and next week?<br>
Hansu: Maybe if you see him and know that he is well, then you will not need to see him so much. He has chosen this life, Sunja, and maybe he wants us to respect that.<br>
Sunja: He's my son.<br>
Hansu: And mine.<br>
Sunja: Noa and Mozasu. They're my life.<br>
Hansu nodded. He had never felt this way about his children. Not really.<br>
Sunja: I've lived only for them.<br>
Hansu: Look. He's coming out.<br>
...Sunja opened the car door and stepped out.<br>
"Noa!" she cried, and rushed toward him.<br>
...Sunja: I know Mozasu would like to see you. When can you come to see us?<br>
Noa: I don't know. I don't know if I can.<br>
Sunja: Haven't we wasted enough time? All these years. Noa, have mercy. Have mercy, please. Umma was a girl when I met Hansu. I didn't know he was married, and when I found out, I refused to be his mistress. Then your father married me so you could have a proper name. All my life, I was faithful to your father, Baek Isak, who was a great man. even after he died, I have been true to his--<br>
Noa: I understand what you did. However, my blood father is Koh Hansu. That cannot change... I'm a Korean working in his filthy business. I suppose having yakuza in your blood is something that controls you. I can never be clean of him... This is my curse.<br>
Sunja: But you're not a yakuza. Are you? Mozasu owns pachinko parlors and he's very honest. He's always saying how it is possible to be a good employer and to avoid the bad people as long as you--<br>
Noa: Umma, I am honest, but there are people you cannot avoid in this business. I run a very large company, and I do what I have to do.<br>
Sunja: You're a good boy, Noa. I know you are--I mean, I'm sure you're a good businessman. And honest.<br>
...Noa: No one knows I'm Korean. Not one person.<br>
Sunja: I won't tell anyone. I understand. I'll do whatever--<br>
Noa: My wife doesn't know. Her mother would never tolerate it. My own children don't know, and I will not tell them. My boss would fire me. He doesn't employ foreigners. Umma, no one can know--<br>
Sunja: Is it so terrible to be Korean?<br>
Noa: It is terrible to be me.<br>
...Sunja: The children, what are their names?<br>
Noa: What does it matter?<br>
Sunja: Noa, I'm so sorry. Your father brought us to Japan, and then, you know, we couldn't leave because of the war here and then the war there. There was no life for us back home, and now it's too late. Even for me.<br>
Noa: I went back.<br>
Sunja: What do you mean?<br>
Noa: I'm a Japanese citizen now, and I can travel. i went to South Korea to visit. To see my supposed motherland.<br>
Sunja: You're a Japanese citizen? How? Really?<br>
Noa: It's possible. It is always possible.<br>
Sunja: And did you go to Busan?<br>
Noa: Yes, and I visited Yeongdo(the town Sunja grew up in). It was tiny but beautiful... Umma, I have a meeting now. I'm sorry, but why don't we see each other next week? I'll come by. I want to see Mozasu again. I have to take care of some urgent things now.<br>
Sunja: Really? You'll come? Oh, thank you, Noa. I'm so glad. You're such a good--<br>
Noa: It's best if you leave now. I'll phone you later tonight when you get home... We'll talk later.<br>
...That evening, when Noa did not call her, she realized that she had not given him her home number in Yokohama. In the morning, Hansu phoned her. Noa had shot himself a fwe minutes after she'd left his office.

Mozasu: What's the matter with you? You look like shit.<br>
Haruki: A kid jumped off a building. Had to talk with his parents today.<br>
Mozasu: Ugh. How old?<br>
Haruki: Middle school. Korean.<br>
Mozasu: Ehh?<br>
Haruki: You should have seen what the rotten kids wrote on his yearbook.<br>
Mozasu: Probably the same shit kids wrote in mine.<br>
Haruki: Maji?<br>
Mozasu: Yeah, every year, a bunch of knuckleheads would tell me to go back to Korea or to die a slow death. Just mean kid stuff... You have a weakness for Koreans. You idiot.<br>
Haruki started to cry.<br>
Mozasu: What the hell? Hey, hey. (Patting Haruki back).<br>
Haruki: The poor kid couldn't take any more.<br>
Mozasu: Listen, man, there's nothing you can do. This country isn't going to change. Koreans like me can't leave. Where we gonna go? But the Koreans back home aren't changing, either. In Seoul, people like me get called Japanese bastards, and in Japan, I'm just another dirty Korean no matter how much money I make or how nice I am. So what the fuck? All those people who went back to the North are starving to death or scared shitless... People are awful. Drink some beer.<br>
Haruki: When I was a boy, I wanted to die.<br>
Mozasu: Me too. Every fucking day. I thought it would be better if I died, but I couldn't do it to my mother. Then after I left school, I didn't feel that way anymore. But after Yumi[his wife] died, I didn't know if i was going to make it. You know? But then I couldn't do it to Solomon (Mozasu's son). And my mother, well, you know, she changed after Noa disappeared. I can never let her down like that. My mother said that my brother left because he couldn't handle Waseda and was ashamed. He's living somewhere else, and he doesn't want us to find him. I think he just got tired of trying to be a good Korean and quit. I was never a good Korean... But things get better. Life is shitty, but not all the time. Etsuko's[new girlfriend] great. I didn't expect her to come along. You knw, I'm going to help her open a restaurant.<br>
Haruki: She's a nice lady. Maybe you'll get married again.<br>
Mozasu: Etsuko doesn't want to get married again. Her kids hate her enough already. It'd be hell for her if she married a Korean pachinko guy... Man, life's going to keep pushing you around, but you have to keep playing.<br>
Haruki: I used to think if my father hadn't left, then I'd be okay.<br>
Mozasu: Forget him. Your mother was a great lady; my wife thought she was the best of the best. Tough and smart and always fair to everyone. She was better than having five fathers. Yumi said she was the only Japanese she'd ever work for.<br>
Haruki: Yeah. Mama was a great lady... I didn't know kids wrote that stuff on your yearbooks. You were always watching out for me. I didn't know.<br>
Mozasu: Forget it. I'm okay. I'm okay now.

It was fair to say that almost everyone at the [pachinko] parlor wanted to make some extra money by gambling. However, the players also came to escape the eerily quiet streets where few said hello, to keep away from the loveless homes where wives slept with children instead of husbands, and to avoid the overheated rush-hour train cars where it was okay to push but not okay to talk to strangers. When Haruki was a younger man, he had not been much of a pachinko player, but since moving to Yokohama, Haruki allowed himself to find some comfort here.

A retiring detective had failed to complete a report of a suicide, and eventually it landed on Haruki's desk. A twelve-year-old Korean boy had jumped off the roof of his apartment building.[The boy, Tetsuo, and his parents were all born in Japan but Korean descent.]<br>
...The Korean boy's father: You didn't get a chance to see this. You should know what happened. Those children should be punished.<br>
...The book was a middle school graduation album. Haruki opened the thick volume...there were a few handwritten messages over the faces of the photographs.<br>
"Tesuo--good luck in high school. Hiroshi Noda."<br>
"You draw well. Kayako Mitsuya."<br>
Then the father prompted him to check the flyleaf.<br>
"Die, you ugly Korean."<br>
"Stop collecting welfare. Koreans are ruining this country."<br>
"Poor people smell like farts."<br>
"If you kill yourself, our high school next year will have one less filthy Korean."<br>
"Nobody likes you."<br>
"Koreans are troublemakers and pigs. Get the hell out. Why are you here anyway?"<br>
"You smell like garlic and garbage!!!"<br>
"If I could, I'd cut your head off myself, but I don't want to get my knife dirty!"<br>
Haruki: Your son, he never mentioned that others were bothering him?<br>
Boy's mother: No. He never complained. Never. He said he was never discriminated against... It was not because he was Korean. That sort of thing was from long ago. Things are better now. We know many kindhearted Japanese.<br>
Haruki: Did you speak with his teachers?<br>
... The teachers had said that the boy was a strong student but too quiet.<br>
... Boy's mother: He had top marks. The children were jealous of him because he was smarter than they were. My son learned to read when he was three.<br>
Boy's father: Last winter, Tetsuo(boy who committed suicide) asked if he could stop going to school and instead work in the vegetable store that his uncle owns... we didn't want him to quit. It didn't make any sense for him to work in a job like that and to give up school when he's such a good student... My wife wanted him to get a good job in an electronics factory... Working in the basement of a grocery store. Counting inventory. That's not an easy life for anyone, you know. He was talented. He could remember any face and draw it perfectly. He could do many things we didn't' know how to do.<br>
Boy's mother: My son was hardworking and honest. He never hurt anyone. He helped his sisters do their homeowrk... Why can't the children who wrote this be punished? Why?<br>
...Haruki: There were several people who witnessed him jump with no one else on the roof. Your son was not pushed. We cannot arrest everyone who says or writes something mean-spirited--<br>
Boy's father: Why can't the police make the principal-- You people work together to make sure nothing ever changes. Sho ga nai. Sho ga nai. That's all I ever hear.<br>
Haruki: I'm sorry. I am sorry.

When Totoyama-san finally died after a great deal of suffering, Haruki(Totayama's son) asked his exhausted wife what he should do with his mother's shop, and Ayame's answer surprised him.<br>
Ayame: We should sell it and move to Yokohama. I don't want to live in Osaka anymore. I never liked working at the shop. I did it because I could never disappoint your mother. We don't have to worry about money anymore. If there's any free time, I want to learn how to bake cakes. Daisuke(Haruki's younger autistic brother) likes cakes. I will stay home and take care of him.<br>
...Haruki was grateful for her[Ayame's] thoughtfullness. He could not help but admire his wife's ability to solve problems and manage so many new things without ever complaining. She was five years older than he was, the eldest daughter raised in a deeply conservative Buddhist family, and he assumed that her strict upbringing had much to do with her ability to forbear and endure. His mother told him on more than one occasion that Ayame loved him, though he didn't deserve it.

Guide: When this magnificent castle started to list this much, everyone remembered Tada Kasuke's curse!<br>
Koichi[Noa's son]: What is a curse?<br>
Noa frowned, because the child had been reminded repeatedly that he must not blurt out questions whenever he wished.<br>
Guide: A curse? A curse is a terrible, terrible thing. And a curse with moral power is the worst! Tada Kasuke was unfairly persecuted when he was just trying to save all the good people of Nagano from the exploitation of those who lived in this castle! At his death, Tada Kasuke uttered a curse against the greedy MIzuno clan!<br>
Koichi wanted to ask another question, but his twin sisters, who were now standing by him, pinched the little bit of flesh around his right elbow. Koichi had to learn not to talk so much, they though; policing him was a family effort.<br>
Guide: Almost two hundred years after Tada Kasuke's death, the ruling clan tried everything in their power to appease the spirit of the martyr to lift the curse. It must have worked, because the castle structure is straight again!<br>
Koichi: How? How do you reverse a curse? (unable to control himself.)<br>
His sister Ume stepped on his foot, but Koichi did not care.<br>
Guide: To appease the spirits, the ruling clan proclaimed that Tada Kasuke was a martyr and gave him an afterlife name. They had a statue built. Ultimately, the truth must be acknowledged.

Noa had noticed [Risa's] beautiful handwriting on the files even before he noticed her. It was possible that he was in love with the way she wrote the number two--her parallel lines expressing a kind of free movement inside the invisible box that contained the ideograph's strokes. If Risa wrote even an ordinary description of an invoice, Noa would pause to read it again, not because of what it said, but because he could detect that there was a kind of danicng spirit in the hand that wrote such elegant letters.<br>
...The marriage [between Noa and Risa] was a stable one, and eight years passed quickly. The couple did not quarrel. Noa did not love Risa in the way he had his college girlfriend, but that was a good thing, he thought. Never again, he wrote, would he be that vulnerable to another person. Noa remained careful around his new family. Though he valued his wife and children as a kind of second chance, in no way did he see his current life as a rebirth. Noa carried the story of his life as a Korean like a dark, heavy rock within him. Not a day passed when he didn't fear being discovered [for he was posing as completely Japanese]. The only thing he continued to do from before was to read his English-language novels. After marrying, he no longer ate at the employees' cafeteria. Now he allowed himself lunch at an inexpensive restaurant where he ate alone. Over lunch, for thirty minutes a day, he reread Dickens, Trollope, or Goethe, and he remembered who he was inside.

Like a Buddhist nun, Sunja wore no makeup, not even moisturizer. It was as if she had decided some time ago that she would not care what she looked like beyond being clean, as if to pay penance for having once cared about such things, when in fact she had not.<br>
Yumi(Mozasu's wife): Did Mozasu tell you about my mother?<br>
Sunja: That she worked in a bar.<br>
Yumi: She was a prostitute. My father was her pimp. They weren't married.<br>
Sunja: I'm sure she was a good person. I'm sure she cared for you very much.<br>
Sunja believed this. She had loved Hansu, and then she had loved Isak. However, what she felt for her boys, Noa and Mozasu, was more than the love she'd felt for the men; this love for her children felt like life and death. After Noa had gone, she felt half-dead. She could not imagine any mother feeling differently.

[Noa] was raised as a Christian, but he felt respectful of Buddhists, especially those who had renounced the spils of the world. The Lord was supposed to be everywhere, which was what Noa had learned at church, but would God keep away from temples or shrines?

How could [Sunja] defend gangsters? There were organized criminals everywhere, she supposed, and she knew that they did bad things, but she knew that many of the Koreans had to work for the gangs because there were no other jobs for them. The government and good companies wouldn't hire Koreans, even educated ones. All these men had to work, and there were many of them who lived in their neighborhood who were far kinder and more respectful than the men who didn't work at all. She couldn't say this to her son, however, because Noa was someone who had studied, labored, and tried to lift himself out of their street, and he thought all the men who hadn't done so weren't very bright, either. He would not understand. Her son could not feel compassion for those who did not try.<br>
Sunja: Noa, forgive me. Umma is sorry. I just wanted you to go to school. I know how much you wanted that. I know how hard you--<br>

Noa stared at [Akiko, his girlfriend]. [Akiko] would always believe that [Noa] was someone else, that he wasn't himself but some fanciful idea of a foreign person; she would always feel like she was soeone special because she had condescended to be with someone everyone else hated. His presence would prove to the world that she was a good person, an educated person, a liberal person. Noa didn't care about being Korean when he was with her; in fact, he didn't care about being Korean or Japanese with anyone. He wanted to be, to be just himself, whatever that meant; he wanted to forget himself sometimes. But that wasn't possible. It would never be possible with her[Akiko].<br>
...Noa: You and I. It cannot be.<br>
Akiko: Why?<br>
Noa: Because it cannot.<br>
There was nothing else he could think of, and he wanted to spare her the cruelty of what he had learned, because she would not believe that she was no different than her [racist] parents, that seeing him as only Korean--good or bad--was the same as seeing him only as a bad Korean. She could not see his humanity, and Noa realized that this was what he wanted most of all: to be seen as human.

When [Yumi, Mozasu's future wife,] focused on her work, Yumi could not be distracted. She was like that about everything and could be left alone working for hours. Mozasu couldn't imagine being so quiet all the time; he would miss the bustle of the pachinko parlor. He loved all the moving pieces of his large, noisy business. His Presbyterian minister father had believed in a divine design, and Mozasu believed that life was like this game where the player could adjust the dials yet also expect the uncertainty of factors he couldn't control. He understood whyy his customers wanted to play something that looked fixed but which also left room for randomness and hope.<br>
...Mozasu: Yumi says that it might be good for him in America. Then again, she thinks everyone is better off in America. She said it's not like it is here in Japan, where a person can't be different.

[Noa] had admired Daniel's courage and goodness throughout the book, and he had not thought much about Eliot's political design. Was it possible that Eliot was suggesting that foreigners, no matter how much she admired them, should leave England? At this point in the course, everyone in the room despised Akiko, but suddenly [Noa] admired her courage to think so differently and to suggest such a different truth. He felt lucky to be at a university and not in most other settings, where the person in charge was always right. Nevertheless, until he really listened to Akiko disagree with the professor, he had not thought for himself fully, and it had never occurred to him to disagree in public.

I think I should share with you that I did not intend to be a fiction writer. I did not intend to write a historical novel. I did not intend to be here. This is all quite a big surprise to me. I did intend always, however, to tell the truth. And I think that when you are committed to the truth, there's something that keeps you going and makes you pay attention, and it makes you care about the way you present the truth.

I did try to make the argument that in life, we are constantly forced to make choices when we don't want to. We are shuttled about by aspects of politics as well as individual choices of people who love us who we don't love. All those people around us making us choose and move us around and yet, we have to react purposefully and somehow still try to live our lives with integrity. So for me, it's a constant feat of how do you deal with the plan that you don't make--and that's what life is.

History has failed us, but no matter.<br>
Min Jin Lee: That's my thesis statement. I was trying to argue that I think history has failed ordinary people around the world because we're not documented, we're not recorded, and we don't understand what's happened to us, because all of us, historically, so many people didn't leave primary documents. So it's not that historians are bad people. They're not elitists. It's just that they can't. So, if you're illiterate, for example, people don't know anything about you, unless people are recording you in real time.

I'd love for people to talk about a community because very often people talk about the immigration the refugee issues, as well as xenophobia. All those things are absolutely in the book, but I'm interested in the idea of, when you have a student, how does she see herself in a community? What is her role? Because I think, in the U.S., we have so much about individuality. And I think, actually, individuals are really important, but what's really important is how we're connected to each other.

Hansu: Just study. Learn everything. Fill your mind with knowledge--it's the only kind of power no one can take away from you.<br>
Hansu never told him to study, but rather to learn, and it occurred to Noa that there was a marked difference. Learning was like playing, not labor.<br>
... If anything, [Noa] wanted a very simple life filled with nature, books, and perhaps a few children. He knew that later in life, he also wanted to be let alone to read and to be quiet. In his new life in Tokyo, he had discovered jazz music, and he liked going to bars by himself and listening to records that the owners would select from bins. Listening to live music was too expensive, but he hoped that one day, when he had a job again, he would be able to go to a jazz club. At the bar, he would have one drink that he'd barely touch to pay for his seat, then he'd go back to his room, read some more, write letters to his family, then go to sleep.

Kyunghee: [Kim Changho] has a right to have children. I couldn't give him any. I don't even have blood anymore.<br>
Sunja: Maybe you're more important than children... Sister, he would not have cared about children. He would have been happy to have just been with you. You are like an angel in this world.<br>
Kyunghee: No. I'm selfish. Yoseb [her husband] isn't.<br>
Sunja didn't understand.<br>
...Kyunghee: It cannot be right to have two men care fo you that way and to allow it.<br>
Sunja nodded, but it didn't make sense. Were you supposed to have only one person in your life? Her mother had her father and no one else? Was her person Hansu or Isak? Did Hansu love her or had he just wanted to use her? If love required sacrifice, then Isak had really loved her. Kyunghee had served her husband faithfully without complaint. There was no one as kindhearted and lovely as her sister-in-law--why couldn't she have more than one man love her? Why did men get to leave when they didn't get what they wanted? Or had Changho suffered enough waiting? Sunja wanted her sister-in-law to make Changho wait, but it wouldn't have been Kyunghee if she had made him do so. Changho had loved someone who would not betray her husband, and perhaps that was why he had loved her. She could not violate who she was.

[Kim Changho] had told [Kyunghee] that he was leaving only a week ago, and it was difficult to think of him being gone, but it was the right thing. He was a young man who believed in building a great country for others. She admired him, because he didn't even have to go there. He had a good job and friends.<br>
...[Kyunghee] didn't want to hurt [Kim Changho]. All these years, his adoration and kindness had nourished her but had also caused her anguish, because she could not care for him in that way. It was wrong to do so.<br>

When Isak had tried to explain heaven, she had imagined her hometown as paradise--a clear, shimmering beauty. Even the memory of the moon and stars in Korea seemed different than the cold moon here; no matter how much people complained about how bad things were back home, it was difficult for Sunja to imagine anything but the bright, sturdy house that her father had taken care of so well by the green, glassy sea, the bountiful garden that had given them watermelons, lettuces, and squash, and the open-air market that never ran out of anything delicious. When she was there, she had not loved it enough.

Kyunghee: But you just said, we quarrel. I suppose it's like when two grannies have a dispute, and the villagers constantly whisper in their ears about the wickedness of the other one.

Yoseb wanted to believe that this uniformed man was not all bad--he was just another man who was donig a job he didn't like, and he was tired because it was the end of the week.

Isak: Do you think it's important for us to feel what God feels?<br>
Pastor Shin: Yes, of course. If you love anyone, you cannot help but share his suffering. If we love our Lord, not just admire him or fear him or want things from him, we must recognize his feelings; he must be in anguish over our sins. We must understand this anguish. The Lord suffers with us. He suffers like us. It is a consolation to know this. To know that we are not in fact alone in our suffering.

Throughout [Isak's] life, everyone around him had talked about his early death as a certainty. He had  been sick as an infant and throughout his youth with serious ailments in his chest, heart, and stomach. Consequently, little had been expected of his future. When Isak graduated from seminary, even he had been surprised that he was alive to see such a day. Oddly enough, all the talk of his inevitable death hadn't discouraged him. He had become almost inured to death; his frailty had reinforced his conviction that he must do something of consequence while had the time.<br>
His brother Samoel, the eldest son, was never ill, but he had died young. He had been beaten badly by the colonial police after a protest and did not survive the attack. Isak decided then that he would live a braver life.

SHELBY You were right. It was the gearbox. We ran too hot. Three out of four broke. Rod blew on the other. We're goin back. They said I got "carte blanche". I looked up and it's French for "horse shit". They'll squeeze our nuts even harder soon as they work out how.<br>
MILES The ice cream's melting.<br>
SHELBY You want me to apologize? You want me to beg?<br>
MILES I don't know, try it out let's see how it feels.<br>
SHELBY OK. I'm sorry. Sincerely. (Imploring voice) "I neeeeed you". Happy now? (Again) "I can't do this without yooouuu."(Furious) Do you know the shit I have had to eat just to get four wheels on that grid? No. YOU DON'T, because you don't to deal with any of that "crap". Now, we don't have time for this. You wanna go in get a shower. We got work to do. That race car ain't gonna fix itself.<br>
They fight each other.<br>
MILES (Panting) Mollie, honey?<br>
MOLLIE Yes dear?<br>
MILES Can I get a soda?<br>
MOLLIE You want one too Shelby?<br>
SHELBY Yes please Mollie.<br>
MILES Uh-uh. Not for him. Just for me please. He can get his own. How long is that now?<br>
SHELBY Must be three, four years.<br>
MILES Out at Riverside.<br>
SHELBY The SCCA Divisional. You broke my finger.<br>
MILES I checked that oil pressure. Twice.<br>
SHELBY Bullshit.<br>
MILES That thing you do. That nippy under the arm thing.<br>
SHELBY "The Llama bite."<br>
MILES Where'd you pick that up? The girl scouts?<br>
SHELBY Oh. You wanna go again?<br>
MILES No.<br>
SHELBY Thank Christ for that. Thanks Mollie.<br>
MOLLIE My pleasure. Honey I'm going to the store for groceries. You want me to get anything special?<br>
MILES (starts picking things up) Uh. Let's see. Ice cream. Ice cream would be good.<br>
MOLLIE (moving off) See you later!<br>
MILES You still taking those things?<br>
SHELBY Only because they're so delicious. ‘Must be quite a burden walking around with all that integrity, Ken. Must make your legs tired. We're gonna have to cut some of that weight we want this car to go anywhere this year. Nothing's stopping you, Bulldog. Except you.<br>
MILES Really. How so?<br>
SHELBY Last month in France, I stood by the starting line at dawn, mist coming off the pavement. I could smell the pines and hear the swifts flying over, and I had one thought. That I'd give everything, anything to be climbing in a car that day. I can't. But you can. You just gotta bend a little bit.<br>
MILES Ford don't get it. They never will.<br>
SHELBY They don't have to get it. Ford cares about one thing. Selling cars. Right now they need us. And we need them. You know anyone else got eight million bucks?<br>
MILES What is it about you and bullshit Shelby. Is it the aroma? Or the actual taste. I mean, which is it.<br>
SHELBY A delicious combination of the two.<br>
MILES If Ford could sell one more unit by screwing us over....<br>
SHELBY They'd do it. And they'd be right to. Does Henry Ford owe you a race car Ken? I don't think so. How long have we known each other. In all that time have I ever broken a promise to you? I will put you in a driving seat on the start grid at Le Mans next year, even if it kills me. Just please try not to be an asshole.<br>
MILES Shelby-<br>
SHELBY Tell me one other thing you've thought about in the past six weeks.<br>
MILES I've thought about kicking your ass-<br>
SHELBY -Apart from that.<br>
MILES Get Remington to make up the ring and pinion gears with an offset angle in the shims. Lower the friction caused by vibration. That'll fix the gearbox.<br>
MOLLIE Don't break his heart again.<br>
SHELBY What? I.. Mollie, he's not the easiest guy to--<br>
MOLLIE He wanted a shot. To see what he could do. You stole that from him. You should understand what that feels like better than anyone. </p>

From Ford V Ferrari<br>
IACOCCA: We made mistakes. Mr Ford. There's a difference between Ford and Ferrari. Between our methods.<br>
HENRY FORD II: Apart from the fact he came in 1, 2, 3 and we failed to cross the finish? Apart from the fact we're the biggest firm in the world and I could lose his tin-pot operation down the back of my couch?<br>
BEEBE: Are you insane? The guy's a snake-oil salesman. A Stetson. Yesterday man. A good driver who's washed up.<br>
IACOCCA: Shelby is a winner. He knows how.<br>
BEEBE: What you're saying, what I'm hearing, is that in light of this debacle, you're prepared to stake your reputation on this guy.<br>
IACOCCA: Yes I am.<br>
SECRETARY: Mr. Ford will see you now.<br>
SHELBY: Mr. Ford. Gentlemen.<br>
HENRY FORD II: Shelby. Give me one reason why I don't fire everyone associated with this abomination, starting with you.<br>
SHELBY: Well, Sir. I've been thinking of that very question as I sat out in your lovely waiting room. And while I was sitting there, I watched that little red folder right there go through five pairs of hands before it got to your mitts. And that's not including the twenty two Ford employees who must've poked at it before it got to the 19th floor. With all due respect, sir, you can't win a race by committee. It's like trying to run with a load in your pants. You need one man in charge. The good news is, you ask me, even with the extra weight in the trunk, we still managed to put ol' Ferrari right where we want him.<br>
FORD: Did we.<br>
SHELBY: Oh yes.<br>
FORD: Expand.<br>
SHELBY: Well. Sure we haven't worked out how corner. Or stay cool. Or stay on the ground. And a lot of stuff broke. In fact the only thing that didn't break is the brakes. Right now we don't even know if the paint lasts 24 hours. But our last lap clocked 218mph down the Mulsanne straight. Now in all his years of racing, Enzo ain't seen nothing move that fast. And now, he knows we're faster than him. Even with the wrong driver. And the committees. That's what he's sitting in Modena thinking about, right now. He's worried this year you might actually be smart enough to give me the control I need to win. (looks at them all) So yes. I'd say you got Ferrari exactly where you want him. You're welcome.<br>
FORD: See that little building down there? In WW2 three out of five US bombers rolled off that line. You think Roosevelt beat Hitler? Think again. This isn't the first time Ford Motor's gone to war in Europe. We know how to do more than push paper. And-- (points to himself) --there is one man running this company. And you report to him. (He turns) Go ahead, Shelby. Go to war.<br>
SHELBY: Thank you, Mr Ford.<br>
BEEBE: Mr. Ford, you know I never criticize your decisions. But Shelby's a liability. Do you sincerely believe we can trust him to run an entire-<br>
FORD: Of course I don't. I don't trust him an inch. And I never told him he would be running anything. Shelby's our wildcard. But he's not our only card. (Beebe turns to go) I'm giving him slack on the leash, Leo. For now. Come Spring, I'll put you in charge. You can make sure we do things The Ford Way.<br>
IACOCCA: I gotta hand it to you Shelby. You've got some balls.<br>
SHELBY: Not even my wife got to screw me the same way twice, Lee. I'll be in touch. </p>

JANITOR: Race is starting soon. Want it on the radio?<br>
MILES: Not unless you do.<br>
RADIO: Ford number 1. New lap record 3 minutes 42 seconds. Top speed 198mph. Ford lead by 38 seconds. McLaren in the Ford GT 40 pits, 50 seconds ahead of Ferrari.<br>
JIM MCKAY (RADIO): What do you think Phil?<br>
PHIL HILL (RADIO): Well. This race is at quite a pace.<br>
MILES: Racing too hot.<br>
RADIO: And the Number 7 Ford driven by Bondurant seems to be losing power. Yes it seems Number 7 is out of the race with mechanical problems.<br>
MILES: Head gasket. Car's not a moon rocket-<br>
RADIO: McLaren is flat out chasing the Ferrari. He's tearing through the esses. He's taken the lead for Ford. Ford is in the lead.<br>
MILES: ...too soon. Surely too soon.<br>
RADIO (CONT'D): Smoke is pouring from McLaren's GT40, he's slowing. Yes. He's out. Surtees takes the lead for Ferrari!<br>
MILES: Gearbox. I told them--...Who's there?<br>
MOLLIE: What's that you're listening to..<br>

From Ford V Ferrari<br>
SHELBY: Hell of a line up. Ken Miles. Phil Hill. Chris Amon. Bruce McLaren.<br>
IACOCCA: Hill's a lock. Amon. McLaren too.<br>
BEEBE: We're less sure about Miles.<br>
IACOCCA: We like Richie Ginter, Masten Gregory...Bob Bondurant?<br>
SHELBY: You want the best driver for the car. Understands the machine. That's Miles.<br>
BEEBE: I may not get the finer points of racing Mr. Shelby but I know people. Miles is a beatnik. He dresses like one. Ford means reliability. Ken Miles is not a Ford man.<br>
SHELBY: Beatnik? That man landed a bust tank on the beach at D-Day, drove it clean across Europe to Berlin. Is that a beatnik?<br>
BEEBE: Shelby, I have the full backing of--<br>
SHELBY: Long time ago, Lee here asked me what's the one thing money can't buy. And the real answer is a pure racer behind the wheel. That's Ken Miles.<br>
BEEBE: Be that as it may, we think he may be too pure.<br>
SHELBY: Uh Huh. Too pure. Now explain what the fuck that means.<br>
BEEBE: It means he's all about himself.<br>
REMINGTON: What's the lap record here?<br>
BURT (TEST DRIVER): 1.58.<br>
REMINGTON: (holds up stopwatch) 1.50 Dead.[Mile's time.]<br>
ROY LUNN: He's clocking way over 200MPH.<br>
BEEBE: ABC puts a microphone under his nose. Perhaps there's a detail he dislikes. Millions watching. Do you trust him not to send the wrong message to millions of potential Ford buyers?<br>
SHELBY: Well, OK, Sure. You can put a Mr. Clean cut all American poster boy in that car, Mr. Beebe. Teach him what to say. Shit, you can put Doris Day in there if all you wanna do is lose.<br>
BEEBE: You're saying you can't agree with us on this issue?<br>
SHELBY: I'm saying you're gonna have to trust me on this one.<br>
BEEBE: I'm afraid, with marketing concerns, that's not possible. Put a Ford type driver in a Ford car, Mr. Shelby. That's the Ford way.<br>
SHELBY: In that case, Gentlemen you don't need a race team. You need an ad agency.<br>
IACOCCA: Shelby...<br>
SHELBY: Boys. You tell me I gotta perform a miracle. You give me only a couple months to do it.<br>
SHELBY And I say “okay”. You tell me I gotta work through your committees and play nice with all your suits and your Poindexters. And I say “okay”.<br>
BEEBE: We built you your own God damned laboratory, Shelby!<br>
SHELBY: And now, it's quarter to midnight and we just might be on the verge of somethin', and now you tell me--<br>
BEEBE: What an ungrateful--<br>
SHELBY: -- Now, you tell me I can't have the best man in the world behind the wheel, who knows the thing better than anyone, because he might step on someone's toes while he drives your unholy beast to victory.<br>
BEEBE: Yes. That's what I'm telling you.<br>
SHELBY: We're done here. I quit.<br>
IACOCCA: Shelby'.. Shelby. Wait up. (He catches up.) C'mon Shelby'. Don't lose the big picture. Today's a great day. We're in with a shot here.<br>
SHELBY: You got ten thousand parts, Lee, all moving in harmony. You don't need me.<br>
IACOCCA: Hey. You think Beebe gives a shit about Le Mans? He just won his Le Mans. By getting rid of you.<br>
SHELBY: Know what? I think you're scared for your job, Lee.<br>
IACOCCA: Sure I am. And I think you are too. Who is Carroll Shelby in five years time? In Ten. Twenty. What is that name gonna mean to people? Life has given you two golden opportunities. Driving Le Mans in ‘59 and running this race team. No-one gets three.<br>
IACOCCA (CONT'D) (cont'd) Right now, you got to think of one thing and one thing only. Shelby American.<br>
MILES: (pulls off helmet) I can't say how long it can keep that up...but if it can...<br>
MILES Forty inches?<br>
REMINGTON: Yeah. But now your carriage is too high again. Y'gonna have drag down there.<br>
MILES: (wiping hands) For one lap. To pass inspection. The wedges will fall out and we'll drop back down to 38.<br>
CHARLIE: I think the title's in the bag for Ferrari, boss.<br>
SHELBY: (his mind elsewhere) ...Yeah. (a thought, turns) You got a passport kid?<br>
CHARLIE: Say what?<br>
SHELBY: Sign this. Get a passport. You got till Friday. You too Phil..<br>
CHARLIE: I'm going! I'm going to France..<br>
SHELBY: Ken. Can I get a word?<br>
SHELBY Take a seat Ken..<br>
MILES: You know why Ford named it the GT-40? Why they put the 40 on there?<br>
SHELBY: No Ken.<br>
MILES: Regulations. GT's gotta be 40 inches high to make the ground clearance requirements. No more, no less. They measure it before every race.<br>
SHELBY: Uh huh.<br>
MILES: Problem is, at that height, we got too much drag under the car. So we fixed that but now the car is only 38 inches high. Anyway, we got a solution. ‘Gonna use wedges to lift the suspension two inches for the--<br>
SHELBY: You're not coming, Ken. (Miles looks at Shelby) We're taking McLaren. Chris Amon. Phil Hill. Bob Bondurant. (Miles doesn't answer.) It's Ford's call. (Miles stares. Unreadable.) It's their opinion that you're not a good image, so you cannot drive their race car. Putting aside the fact that you made that car whatever the hell it is, and that you're the best man I got behind the wheel--<br>
MILES: (stands) I'm going to re-route the oil line. If there's spillage it could end up dripping onto the rear near side disc.<br>
SHELBY: Ken--<br>
MILES: (stops in the door) Tell the boys watch their pace come sunrise. The gearbox will overheat. </p>

AERONUTRONICS CHIEF ENGINEER: Mr. Miles if there's a problem the computer will find it. This is the same setup we tested the A-3 rocket to Mach 6. Detroit will analyze the data.<br>

then I'd still choose a Chevy Chevelle. And that's a fucking

IACOCCA: Senior creatives. It's really pro-forma, window dressing. To make everybody comfortable.<br>

And they'll all line up to kiss your arse, get their photo taken with the great Carroll Shelby and they'll head on back to their nice offices and dream up new ways to screw you. Why?

SHELBY: It isn't about speed, Lee. It's not like other tracks where all you do is turn left for four hours. Le Mans is about survival. Endurance. Man and machine. One weak link, one wrong move, you might as well stayed home. You need a car that's light enough to travel the straights at 200 miles an hour. But strong enough to do that for 3000 miles without a break. Not just the best car you ever built, but better than whatever Ferrari shows up with. And that only gets you to the green flag. That's where your problems really start.<br>
IACOCCA: So it's challenging.<br>
SHELBY: Le Mans is a 3.5 mile loop of country road. Narrow, ungraded, rough. No camber on the turns. No rails. Imagine that for 300 laps. For 24 hours. Averaging 130. It's dark, it's raining. Slower cars comin' at you outta the fog. You see an upturned Porsche. Driver, pourin' blood, stumblin' around the track. Maybe he's a friend. Maybe he's on fire. And you gotta hit the gas and fight on, hour after hour, until it gets light and finally you see the carnage. You're exhausted, hungry, you can't remember your name, what country you're in, and you realize you're doing 198 on a straight. And if at any point you blow a gasket. A five cent washer. Whole thing's over. Ferrari wins again. Like they won last year and the year before that and the year before that.<br>
IACOCCA: So you're saying you don't think Ford can build the greatest race car the world's ever seen? You're saying we aren't capable of winning an event like that? Even if we had a brilliant partner? Even if we wrote a blank check?<br>
SHELBY: I'm saying you can't buy a win, Lee. But maybe you can buy the man who'llget you a shot.

MILES: I think I do. It's distracting me. It's time to grow up. Pay the bills. Put food on the table. I had my fun.<br>
MOLLIE: You're forgetting something, Ken. See, I know you. I've actually been here these past twenty years. Who is this little speech for?<br>
MILES: The garage didn't pay the bills, Mol. And now its locked up. Racing didn't pay either. Sure, I win races--<br>

IACOCCA: We are honored to be invited to this illustrious place. This merger between our companies willform two entities. Ford-Ferrari: 90 percent owned by Ford who controls all production. Secondly, Ferrari-Ford, the racing team: 90 percent owned by Ferrari. In order to secure this Ford will pay the sum of.. (In Italian) Dieci milioni di dollari..I have only one small question. It concerns my race program. It states that if I need to increase my race budget, I have to request authorization from America.<br>

To your big ugly factory making its ugly little cars, and tell your pig headed boss that all his smug executives are worthless sons of whores...Tell him he is not Henry Ford. HE IS HENRY FORD. THE SECOND. Franco. I'm starving. Let's go eat.<br>
Later on...<br>
HENRY FORD II: I want... the best engineers. The best drivers. I don't care what it costs.We're gonna build a race car and we're gonna bury that greasy, good for nothing, devious wop a hundred feet deep under the Finish Line at Le Mans. And I will be there to watch it. This isn't business. This, gentleman, is war.

No. Because of what his cars meant. Victory. When Ferrari wins at Le Mans, people want some of that victory. What if the Ford badge meant victory? And meant it where it counts. Among the first group of 17 year olds in history with money in their pockets.<br>

So a lot of what I've been thinking about along my own personal journey is kind of how much we contort, and conform, and adjust ourselves all the time, with the best of intentions by the way, it's from a beautiful place. We want people to feel us, we want people to know how much we care about them. Somewhere along the lines, we somehow lose ourselves in that and maybe can't find our way back to ourselves because we're so concerned about what happens, about how everybody else feels; we're so concerned with making other people happy and it's something I've personally experienced and I have a feeling that a lot of you might have felt the same way and so this song, "Gramercy Park," really talks about how that happens

Alicia: Underdog feels like such a story at such a moment. I think we're at a time where we, more than ever, just need to know that we're going to figure it out and we're gonna make it through. I think just for me, I always need to hear those words because sometimes things feel kind of dark so underdog feels triumphant.<br>
Alicia: More Myself. It's a theme. It comes from a place from really understanding more about how to become my authentic self and I wanted to share some of those journeys with you because I think we're all looking for the truth and the realness in our lives.<br>
Alicia: I love hugs. I need them.<br>
Alicia: I hope people take away the conversation and continue having about how do we all create our own destiny as opposed to the expectations that are put on us by other people and sometimes we live out those expectations because we are trying to be the "good" girl or the "good" boy and I would love for us to challenge that talk about how do we just, how do we find our own truth?<br>
Alicia: I want my kids to know kindness, to know empathy. I want them to understand their blessings. Be grateful. Gratitude. I want them to understand how to speak to people clearly and communicate in a way that helps them get across their point of view.<br>
Alicia: Me-time fills me up and I think that's what it is. Like, how do you fill yourself up?<br>

Alicia: Say what you want. Be direct. Be clear. You have to know what you want to say and how you're gonna say it, and deliver it.<br>
Alicia: Growing up in Hell's kitchen gave me the appreciation for truth, for poetry, for the dark soulfulness. It definitely added to that mixture.<br>
Alicia: [Talking about the night of the Grammy's]. It was definitely crazy, you know, we lost Kobe [Bryant] that day, and it was just hours before the show and it was so sad Gigi and all the families that were there. It changed everything. It made everything we planned for go out the window and just had to go with the spirit--had to go with the genuine feeling of how we were all feeling which was devastated... Pivoting is a really important thing that I have been learning: you don't always know what is meant for you and sometimes you just have to be willing to flow and that was a big example of the flow.<br>
Alicia: For me, I really want to create the calm. I really want to create the good energy. I want to welcome people, make people feel good, make people feel loved, make people feel appreciated... I was bringing that good energy.<br>
Alicia: I'm a big mantra lover, a big ritual lover. I'm big on prayer and I just really intend for what I'm hoping to come out of the moment... I'm very spiritual, just very connected to the universe.

Cause we get so caught up in, and life goes so fast, and next thing we know--that's really what links us. So whenever I play this song, I like people to sing with me. So I hope you're not a shy bunch. Don't seem like it. So help me. I say it one time and ya'll say it one time. Ok? So we can exercise the love showing: show me love. You. (Show me love.)

Deep into her thirties, Emira would wrestle with what to take from her time at the Chamberlain house. Some days she carried the sweet relief that Briar would learn to become a self-sufficient person. And some days, Emira would carry the dread that if Briar ever struggled to find herself, she'd probably just hire someone to do it for her.

Kelley's text to Emira: Emira. Holy shit. I just saw your clip from the news. I know things are weird right now, but I'm so proud of you. I always knew you could do it.<br>
Depsite being more broke than she'd ever been in her life, and still grieving the loss of Briar Chamberlain, this complimentary sentiment promptly made it final: there was no way that she and Kelley would ever recover from the acknowledgment that he'd been right about Mrs. Chamberlain. Forming a relationship again would somehow dictate that [Kelley, Emira's ex-boyfriend] could be right about everything else, when really, he had a lot to learn. Emira never texted him again. His name in her phone remained Don't Answer.<br>
...Because even though Kelley had been right about her, Alix had been right about him too (that Kelley fetishizes black girls).

Paula(Emira's boss): You've been here for almost two years, yes? When are you planning on leaving?<br>
Emira: Leaving? Am I getting fired right now?<br>
Paula: God, no. But Emira. I've never had an assistant who wanted to continue being my assistant for more than two years. Basically, if you stayed on for much longer, it would mean I'm doing something wrong.<br>
Emira: Okay, well... I can't believe I'm saying this... but I actually think I'm okay.<br>
Maybe [Emira] wasn't by her girlfriends' standards, but Emira really was doing okay. She'd gone to Mexico for Zara's birthday, all five days. She'd stuck to her New Year's resolution to make her bed every day. She had a savings account, which she dipped into often, but not so much that it didn't exist. She'd also added two new recipes to her dinner circulation, both of which were Crock-Pot meals, but still. Emira also liked Paula and her kid. Her boss was fairly rude to everyone except for her, and Emira went to work feeling paid and protected.<br>
Paula: Good bosses shouldn't make you happy in a job that they wouldn't want to do themselves. It's my job to make you so miserable that you're forced into finding something that brings you joy, and then I help you seal the deal. So... your goal for the next year is to learn how to properly hate your job, and find something else that you wouldn't hate donig. Got it?<br>
Emira: Got it.<br>
[Emira] would stay on as Paula's assistant until Paula retired. It would take Emira four more years to receive Shaunie's(Emira's friend) starting salary of $52,000, but Emira came to know the rare relief of having a boss who was so consumed with her assistant's success that she was never derailed by the idea of being Emira's friend.

Alex(later called Alix) was alone, and the one thing she still had was the freedom to follow the narrative that suited her best.<br>
It would never be a relief to know that a locker malfunction was to blame for her demise, rather than Kelley Copeland himself. Believing that Kelley was the starting point of her adversity would always be easier than believing she'd simply slipped through an unlucky crack. This choice to believe otherwise, to pretend there weren't coffee-colored letters pressed into her chest, would keep her close to him, even if staying close to Kelley meant holding a grudge for something that he never did. And all summer long, as Alex rolled silverware and received lousy tips, it was easier doing it while mad at Kelley, rather than having no relation to him at all.<br>
And by the time Alex moved to New York, it was like she didn't have to pretend.<br>
Kelley was the guy who ruined her senior year, much in the same way that her name was spelled A-l-i-x.

...But Zara would have never used the word still, highlighting the fact that yes, Emira was a bit late to adulthood, that she should have moved on to something else, and that she currently held a job that thirteen-year-olds were trusted to do.

On her own and at her best, Briar[three-year-old] was odd and charming, filled with intelligence and humor. But there was something about the actual work, the practice of caring for a small unstructured person, that left Emira feeling smart and in control. There was the gratifying reflex of being good at your job, and even better was the delightful good fortune of having a job you wanted to be good at. Without Briar, there were all these markers of time that would come to mean nothing. Was Emira just supposed to exist on her own at six forty-five? Knowing that somewhere else it was Briar's bathtime? One day, when Emira would say good-bye to Briar, she'd also leave the joy of having somewhere to be, the satisfaction of understanding the rules, the comfort of knowing what's coming next, and the privilege of finding a home within yourself.<br>
Emira loved the ease in which she could lose herself in the rhythm of childcare. She didn't have to worry about having interesting hobbies. The fact that she still slept on a twin bed meant nothing to Briar or any of their plans. Every day with Briar was a tiny victory that Emira didn't want to give up. Seven o'clock was always a win. Here's your kid. She's happy and alive.

Tamra(Alix's friend): I like Emira. A lot. I actually think it's quite lovely how she and Briar complement each other. It's incredibly sweet to watch. But that girl is very lost. She's twenty-five years old and she has no idea what she wants or how to get it. She doesn't have the motivation to maintain a real career the way our girls will have, which is probably not her fault but it doesn't make it less true. What I'm saying is... there are a lot of jerks like Kelley out there, but when they get hold of girls like Emira? Someone who's still trying to figure herself out? That's when I start to really worry. And the more that I think about it, it makes a lot sense she ended up with a guy like this. He's looking to validate himself through someone else. She hasn't caught on because she doesn't know who she is.

Emira(talking to Kelley, her boyfriend): You will never have to even consider working somewhere that requires a uniform, so you can chill the fuck out about how I choose to make my living... You're not better than anyone, when you hang up your own coat and take your plate to the trash. I've been those girls helping out tonight. I fucking am those girls helping out tonight, and you're not making anything easier by giving them less to do. It's like eating everyone on your plate 'cause you think someone else won't go hungry if you don't. You're not helping anyone but yourself. But that's not even the half of it. You're not seeing the whole situation for what it is. Of course I want a new job. I'd love to make real money and not have spit-up on all my clothes. But I can't... I can't just fucking leave her... I know I have to quit. I know that I can't stay there, and that... raising Briar isn't my job. But I just need to do it on my own terms. I turn twenty-six next week. And... I'm gonna be kicked off my parents' health insurance. I've known for a while that this wasn't exactly sustainable, but I just... yeah, I need to figure it out on my own.<br>
...Kelley: Okay... that was another mistake. But if it makes a difference, I've been there twice before, and I wouldn't have taken you somewhere uncomfortable on purpose.<br>
Emira: Well, yeah, but, that's the point. You think it's comfortable because it's always been that way for you [but not me].<br>
...Kelley: But listen, I obviously think you should start looking in the New Year, but for now, your job is safe. If I were you, I'd take the money and show that kid a really good time before you leave.<br>
Emira: That's an interesting way of looking at it.

Emira: I hate writing thank-you notes.<br>

...These gifts were a perfect moment to emphasize how Peter and Alix wanted Briar to think for herself, rather than think of herself.

This wouldn't have happened if you had a real fucking job, Emira told herself on the train ride home, her legs and arms crossed on top of each other. You wouldn't leave a party to babysit. You'd have your own health insurance. You wouldn't be paid in cash. You'd be a real fucking person. Taking care of Briar was Emira's favorite position so far, but Briar would someday go to school...<br>
Sometimes, when she was particularly broke, Emira convinced herself that if she had a real job, a nine-to-five position with benefits and decent pay, then the rest of her life would start to resemble adulthood as well. She'd do things like make her bed in the morning, and she'd learn to start liking coffee. She wouldn't sit on the floor in her bedroom, discovering new music and creativing playlists until three a.m., only to put herself to bed and think, Why do you do this to yourself?<br>
Emira knew she had to find a new job.

Because the interests of [Emira's] family members had come so naturally to them, and because university seemed like an acceptable place to wait for [Emira's] hands to find themselves, Emira became the first person in her family to attend a four-year college...<br>
Emira didn't mind reading or writing papers, but this was also mostly the problem. Emira didn't love doing anything, but she didn't terribly mind doing anything either...<br>
She returned with a stern suggestino from her father: to find something and to stick with it. So Emira enrolled in transcription school, and she absolutely hated it...<br>
Emira hadn't told her parents about her departure from transcription school. She wanted to be able to replace it with something, rather than a passionless negative space...<br>
Briar[3-year-old] was a welcome break from Emira's constant concern of what to do with her hands and the rest of her life..."Mira? How, how... because--how do you know when you like it? Who says when you like it?" Emira was fairly certain that the caregiver-approved answer was something like, You'll figure it out, or It'll make sense when you're older. But Emira wiped the toddler's chin and said, "That's a really good question. We should ask your mom." She honestly meant it. Emira wished that someone would tell her what she liked doing best. The number of things she could ask her own mother were shrinking at an alarming rate.

INTERVIEWER:  What a week it's been! I don't know about you, but I've been on pins and needles the entire time. Hello. And good evening. I'm your host, Mike Michaelson, and welcome to TruTalk, our forum for issues growing out of the show. But tonight, something very special indeed, a rare exclusive interview with the show's conceiver and creator. So, come with us now as we go live to the Lunar Room on the 221st floor of the OmniCam atmosphere. That's where we'll find the world's greatest televisionary, the designer and architect of the world within a world that is Seahaven Island, Christof. (to Christof) Before we begin, I'd like to thank you on behalf of our audience for granting this exclusive interview. We know how demanding your schedule is and we all know how jealously you guard your privacy. This, sir, is…indeed an honor.<br>
Lunar Room<br>
CHRISTOF:  Don't mention it.<br>
INTERVIEWER:  Well, the catalyst for the recent dramatic events on the show has been, of course, Truman's father, Kirk, and his attempts to infiltrate the show, but before we get into that, I think it's worth knowing that this is not the first time that someone from the outside has attempted to reach Truman, is it?<br>
CHRISTOF:  We have had our close calls in the past.<br>
Flashback: A Childhood Christmas<br>
MAN FROM A GIFT BOX:  Truman! It's television! Yes! Yeah! I did it! I'm on the Truman Show!<br>
Lunar Room<br>
INTERVIEWER:  But there's never been anything to compare with this most recent breach of security the…the first intruder to be a former cast member.<br>
CHRISTOF:  A dead one at that.<br>
INTERVIEWER:  Gotta' say, writing Kirk back in--master stroke.<br>
CHRISTOF:  Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.<br>
Flashback: Truman at the Beach<br>
KIRK:  Truman! Truman, no! That's off limits.<br>
YOUNG TRUMAN:  Why? What's over there?<br>
KIRK:  Nothing. It's dangerous, that's all. You've gotta' know your limitations, Truman.<br>
Lunar Room<br>
INTERVIEWER:  Let's remind viewers of exactly why dad was written out in the first place.<br>
CHRISTOF:  As Truman grew up, we were forced to manufacture ways to keep him on the island.<br>
Flashback: Truman at School<br>
YOUNG TRUMAN:  I'd like to be an explorer. Like the great Magellan.
TEACHER: Oh, you're too late. There's really nothing left to explore.<br>
Lunar Room<br>
CHRISTOF:  Finally, I came up with the concept of Kirk's drowning.<br>
INTERVIEWER:  Most effective. Truman's been terrified of water ever since.<br>
CHRISTOF:  When Kirk read the synopsis for the death at sea episode he was…disappointed, to say the least. And I'm sure that's what caused him to break back onto the set.<br>
INTERVIEWER:  But, how do you intend to explain his 22 year absence?<br>
CHRISTOF:  Amnesia.<br>
...CHRISTOF:  Remember, we started with just one. He was uh...curious from birth. Premature by two weeks, it was almost as if he couldn't wait to get started.<br>
INTERVIEWER:  And of course his eagerness to leave his mother's womb uh...was the very reason he was the one who was selected.<br>
CHRISTOF:  In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies, the casting of the show, determined by an air date, Truman was the one who arrived on cue.<br>
INTERVIEWER:  Incidentally, uh, I believe Truman is the first child to have been legally adopted by a corporation?<br>
CHRISTOF:  That's correct.<br>
INTERVIEWER:  The show uh, has generated uh, enormous revenues now equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.<br>
CHRISTOF:  People forget it takes the population of an entire country to keep the show running.<br>
INTERVIEWER:  Mmm-hmmm. Since the show is on twenty-four hours a day without commercial interruption uh...all those staggering revenues are generated by product placement.<br>
CHRISTOF:  That's true. Everything on the show is for sale. From the actors wardrobes, food products, to the very homes they live in.<br>
INTERVIEWER:  And of course all of it available in the "Truman Catalog" and operators are standing by. Christof, let me ask you, why do you think that uh, Truman has never come close to discovering the true nature of his world until now?<br>
CHRISTOF:  We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. It's as simple as that.<br>
INTERVIEWER:  The Hague, for Christof. Hello…The Hague...All right, we've lost that call, let's go to Hollywood, California, you're on TruTalk.<br>
SYLVIA:  Hi, Christof, I'd just like to say one thing: You're a liar and a manipulator and what you've done to Truman is sick.<br>
CHRISTOF:  Well, we remember this voice, don't we? How could we forget?<br>
INTERVIEWER:  Uh...let's go to another call with…<br>
CHRISTOF:  No. No, no, no, no, no. It--I--It's fine, Mike. I love to reminisce with former members of the cast. Sylvia, as you announced so melodramatically to the world...do you think because you batted your eyes at Truman once, flirted with him, stole a few minutes of air time with him to thrust yourself and your politics into the limelight, that you know him, that you know what's right for him? You really think you're in a position to judge him? <br>
SYLVIA:  What right do you have to take a baby an-an-and turn his life into some kind of mockery? Don't you ever feel guilty?<br>
CHRISTOF:  I have given Truman a chance to lead a normal life. The world. The place you live in...is the sick place. Seahaven is the way the world should be.<br>
SYLVIA:  He's not a performer, he's a prisoner. Look at him. Look at what you've done to him.<br>
CHRISTOF:  He could leave at any time. If his was more than just a vague ambition, if he was absolutely determined to discover the truth, there's no way we could prevent him. I think what distresses you, really, caller, is that ultimately, Truman prefers his "cell," as you call it.<br>
SYLVIA:  That's where you're wrong. You're so wrong. And he'll prove you wrong.<br>
INTERVIEWER:  Well, aside from uh…heated comments from a very vocal minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience.<br>
CHRISTOF:  Yes, for Truman and for the viewing public.<br>
INTERVIEWER:  Well, Christof, I can't thank you enough for giving so generously your time tonight. I think it's safe to say that now that this crisis is behind us and that Truman is back to his old self we can look forward to some exciting new developments.<br>
CHRISTOF:  Well, Mike, the big news is that Meryl will be leaving Truman in an upcoming episode, and a new romantic interest will be introduced.<br>
INTERVIEWER:  Aha!<br>
CHRISTOF:  I'm determined that television's first on-air conception will still take place.<br>
INTERVIEWER:  Well, another television milestone straight ahead…you heard it here first. It has been a singular honor and pleasure, sir. Christof. Thank you.<br>
CHRISTOF:  Thank you, Mike.

T.V.:  And there'll be another episode of I Love Lucy same time tomorrow, but right now, it's time for Golden Oldies. Tonight we present the endearing, much loved classic, "Show me the Way to go Home." A hymn of praise to small town life where we learn that you don't have to leave home to discover what the world's all about. And that no one's poor who has friends. Full of laughter and love, pain and sadness, but ultimately redemption. We share the trials and tribulations of the Abbot family. Note the touching performance of Ronald Griereed as Uncle Buddy. And that scene with the bowl of cherries is going to have you splitting your sides with laughter all over again. And there'll be tears, too, when David and Jennifer are reunited. But enough from me, let's join the Abbots in Camden Village.

Doctor Friend: Why do you paint?<br>
Vincent: I paint...as a matter of fact, to stop thinking.<br>
Friend: A sort of meditation.<br>
Vincent: When I paint, I stop thinking.<br>
Friend: About what?<br>
Vincent: I stop thinking and I feel that I'm a part of everything outside and inside of me. I wanted so much to share what I see. An artist...I thought an artist had to teach how to look at the world. But I don't think that anymore. Now I just think about my relationship to eternity.<br>
Friend: What do you call eternity?<br>
Vincent: Time to come.<br>
Friend: Maybe what you are saying is that your gift to the world is painting.<br>
Vincent: If not, what good is an artist.<br>
Friend: You're happy when you're painting?<br>
Vincent: Most of the time, except when I fail.<br>
Friend: You look sad sometimes.<br>
Vincent: There's a lot of destruction and failure at the door of a successful picture. I find joy in sorrow. And sorrow is greater than laughter. You know an angel is not far from those who are sad. And illness can sometimes heal us. It's the normal state that gives birth to painting.<br>
Friend: You feel that way?<br>
Vincent: Sometimes I hate the idea of regaining my health.<br>
Friend: In that case, you don't need a doctor.<br>

Vincent: Yes, that's what I am.<br>
Priest: Why do you say that? Do you have a gift for painting?<br>
Vincent: Yes.<br>
Priest: Where does this gift come from? Would you say that God gave you the gift of painting?<br>
Vincent: Yes, He did. It's the only gift He gave me.<br>
Priest: Did you paint this?<br>
Vincent: Yes, I did.<br>
Priest: And you call it a painting?<br>
Vincent: Yes, of course.<br>
Priest: Tell me frankly, because I'd like to understand. Why do you say you're a painter?<br>
Vincent: Because I paint. I love painting. I have to paint. I've always been a painter. That, I know.<br>
Priest: A born painter?<br>
Vincent: Yes.<br>
Priest: How do you know?<br>
Vincent: Because I can't do anything else. And believe me, I've tried.<br>
Priest: So God gave you a gift so that you could paint this?<br>
Vincent: Yes.<br>
Priest: But don't you see--now look, carefully. Please. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but don't you see that this painting is...how can I say--unpleasant. It's ugly.<br>
Vincent: Why would God give me a gift to paint ugly and disturbing things? Sometimes I feel so far away from everything.<br>
Priest: Does anybody buy your paintings?<br>
Vincent: No.<br>
Priest: So, you're poor?<br>
Vincent: Yes, rather poor.<br>
Priest: How do you live?<br>
Vincent: Well, my brother, Theo, pays for me to be here. But he's not a rich man either.<br>
Priest: So, you believe that God gave you this gift because He wants to keep you in misery?<br>
Vincent: Huh...I never thought about it that way.<br>
Priest: And which way do you think?<br>
Vincent: Sometimes I think...maybe, maybe... maybe he chose the wrong time.<br>
Priest: What do you mean the wrong time?<br>
Vincent: Maybe God made me a painter for people who aren't born yet.<br>
Priest: Possibly.<br>
Vincent: It is said, "Life is for sowing. The harvest is not here." I paint with my qualities and faults... I think of myself as an exile, a pilgrim on this earth. Jesus said, "Turn your heart away from things visible and turn yourself to things invisible." ... And Jesus was totally unknown when He was alive... I can tell you that Jesus was not discovered until 30 to 40 years after he died. When he was alive, nobody talked about him. There's not even a letter from a Roman centurion to his wife in Rome saying that a man named Jeshua was crucified in Jerusalem with some other criminals. Not a word, nothing... I'm free to go? I hope I'm ready.<br>
Priest: I hope so too.

Patient: I'm an army man. I was a soldier.<br>
Vincent: Are all soldiers crazy?<br>
Patient: Oh, no, soldiers are not crazy, but officers are. All the officers are insane. When they made me a sergeant, I started to feel different. And when I became secreatary to the general, I had all the keys... The keys to all the dossiers of all the officers. And I can tell you, they are all crazy. They've all killed, tortured, mutilated, raped... And during the war, many tunnels were dug. And I knew a Tonkinese girl who was born in a tunnel. She didn't see the daylight for the firist 12 years of her life. Twelve years, gone. Can you imagine that you were a painter not seeing the snow not knowing what it was, what it meant? Twelve years. What do you paint?<br>

Doctor: You're confusing people. You're confusing yourself with your paintings.<br>
Vincent: I am my paintings.<br>
Doctor: What do you mean by consolation and hope? You might be asking too much of people.<br>
Vincent: I'd like to share my vision with people who can't see what I see the way I see.<br>
Doctor: Yes, but why?<br>
Vincent: Because my vision is closer to the reality of the world. I can make people feel what it's like to be alive.<br>
Doctor: Do you feel like they don't feel alive?<br>
Vincent: Yes, I do.<br>
Doctor: And you think you can make them feel that through painting?<br>
Vincent: Yes. Yes, absolutely. Yes... I believe I have a menacing spirit around me. An invisible being. I feel it, I don't see it. He speaks to me and threatens me. And all he wants to do is plunge a knife into my heart. I saw him and I tried to cut him out of myself.<br>
Doctor: So that's the reason why you cut off your ear. Your vision of the world, as you say, is quite frightening. Isn't it?<br>
Vincent: Yes. I'm terrified he'll come back... Without painting, I can't live.<br>

Vincent: I've spent all my life alone, in a room. I need to go out and work to forget myself. I want to be out of control. I need to be in a feverish state. It's called the act of painting for a reason.<br>

Paul: You don't even paint that way. You paint fast and you overpaint. Your surface looks like it's made out of clay. It's more like sculpture than painting.

Paul: Why do you always have to paint from nature?<br>
Vincent: I feel lost if I don't have something to look at. I need something to see. There's so much to see. Every time I look, I see something I've never seen before.<br>
Paul: Yes, but what you paint, what you do belongs to you. You don't need to copy anything.<br>
Vincent: I don't copy.<br>
Paul: I know, but why don't you paint just what's in your mind? What your brain sees?<br>
Vincent: Because the essence of nature is beauty.<br>
Paul: What do you mean?<br>
Vincent: What do you mean, what do I mean? Why did you want to go to Madagascar?<br>
Paul: To get away from society, from people.<br>
Vincent: That may have been part of it, but you went there in search of beauty, and nature was definitely there. And it was different than what you knew before, and it made your paintings look different. When I look at nature, I see more clearly... the tie that unites us all. A vibrating energy speaking in God's voice. Sometimes it's so intense, I lose consciousness.<br>
Paul: Come on.<br>
Vincent: I swear to you. After a while, I wake up and I don't know where I am or what I'm doing. It takes me some minutes to even remember my name.<br>
Paul: Listen, Vincent, the time is coming when painters won't need anymore to look at models and sit down in front of nature. You know why? Because nature is what we see here in our heads. Nothing else! Without our eyes, there's no nature. And none of us sees the world around us the same way. We sit, you and I, in front of the same landscape, we don't see the same mountains, the same trees.<br>
Vincent: Well, that's what I'm saying. The trees that I paint are mine.<br>
Paul: Even the faces you paint are yours. And they'll stay because of you. People will be known because you painted them, and how you painted them, not because of who they are.<br>
Vincent: That's good.<br>
Paul: And people will go to museums to see paintings of people, not to see people who were painted.<br>
Vincent: You know, people don't always like the way they look in my paintings.<br>
Paul: We have to start a revolution. Do you understand? Yes, we do. Us, our generation. We have to change entirely the relation between painting and what you call nature. Between painting and reality, because painted reality is its own reality... They repeat themselves. They've given everything they could give.<br>
Vincent: You have to say thank you for the paintings you like.<br>
Paul: It's our turn. We have a huge responsibility.<br>

Theo: What do you see?<br>

From David Mitchell<br>
You touched on something interesting. You could call it cliche inversion. Of course the [music] managers are going to be con-men. So many of them from the sixties were. If you want to be original just do the opposite. It's initially harder because you then have to conceive a manager who's basically honest and the color has to come not from a Dell boy approach to everything but from well, from elsewhere. But of course by working at how to do it you then get an original character for free. And you would have to spend time on cliche avoidance anyways so it's quite an interesting way to do it. Use the cliche, turn the cliche inside out, make the character everything that the cliche is not, and then work out how you can make that work. It's an approach that often pays off, I've found.

Real freedom. I'd like to be calm and take my time, alone, forget about the rest of the world, and just... paint this. Here. Slowly. What comes to me, nothing else.<br>

Marcus: We shall do well enough, Esca and I.<br>
Uncle Aquila: I have no doubt about it--always supposing that you do not first starve. You will have to build and stock, remember.<br>
Marcus: most of the building we can do ourselves; wattle and daub will serve until we grow rich.<br>
Uncle Aquila: And what will Cottia think of that?<br>
Marcus: Cottia will be content.<br>
Uncle Aquila: Well, you know where to come when you need help.<br>
Marcus: Yes, I know. If we should need help--really need it, after three bad harvests--I will come.<br>
Uncle Aquila: Not until then?<br>
Marcus: Not until then. No.<br>
Uncle Aquila: You are impossible! You grow more and more like your father every day!<br>
Marcus: Do I? Uncle Aquila, you have done so much for Esca and me already. If I had not had you to turn to--<br>
Uncle Aquila: Bah! No one else to turn to me. No son of my own to plague me. If you had applied for that exchange, I believe I should have been rather lonely.<br>
Marcus: Did you think I would be away back to Clusium on the first tide?<br>
Uncle Aquila: I did not think so, no. You have now made me ruin a perfectly good pen and destroy several extremely important notes. I hope you are satisfied... No, I did not think so, but until the time came, and the choice was between your hands, I could not be sure.<br>
Marcus: Nor could I. But I am sure now.<br>
All at once, and seemingly for no particular reason, he was remembering his olive-wood bird. It had seemed to him as the little flames licked through the pyre of birch-bark and dead heather on which he had laid it, that with the childhood treasure, all his old life was burning away. But a new life, a new beginning, had warmed out of the grey ash, for himself, and Esca, and Cottia; perhaps for other people too; even for an unknown downland valley that would one day be a farm.<br>
Somewhere a door slammed, and Esca's step sounded below in the colonnade, accompanied by a clear and merry whistling...  And it came to Marcus suddenly that slaves very seldom whistled. They might sing, if they felt like it or if the rhythm helped their work, but whistling was in some way different; it took a free man to make the sort of noise Esca was making.<br>
Uncle Aquila looked up again from mending the broken pen. "Oh, by the way. I have a piece of news that may interest you, if you have not heard it already. They are rebuilding Isca Dumnoniorum."

Cottia: Then if you cannot go back to the Legions, what will you do?<br>
Marcus: I am not--quite sure.<br>
Cottia: Perhaps you will go home. You will go back to Rome, and take Cub and Esca with you.<br>
Marcus: I do not know, Cottia, truly I do not know. But I do not suppose for a moment that I shall ever go home.<br>
Cottia: Take me too. They will build the city wall round here soon, and you could not leave me in a cage! You could not! Oh, Marcus, take me too!<br>
"Even if it were to Rome?" Marcus said, remembering her old wild hatred of all things Roman.<br>
Cottia: Yes. Anywhere at all, if only it was with you.<br>
Two distinct waves of feeling swept over Marcus, so close upon each other that they were almost one. The first was the joyful surprise of finding, and the second the desolation of losing again... How was he to explain to Cottia that possessing nothing in the world, without even a trade to his hands, he could not take her with him?

From The Eagle of the Ninth by Rosemary Sutcliff<br>
Uncle Aquila: Shall we go up to my study now?<br>
Following the two older men, and once again carrying the Eagle, Marcus had mounted four or five of the watchtower steps before he realized that Esca was not coming up behind, and looking back, he saw him still standing at the foot of the stairs.<br>
"I think that I will not come," Esca said.<br>
"Not come? But you must come."<br>
Esca shook his head. "It is between you and your uncle and the Legate."<br>
Followed as ever by Cub, Marcus came down the few steps again. "It is between the four of us. What maggot has got into your head, Esca?"<br>
"I think that I should not go to your uncle's private sanctum," Esca said stubbornly. "I have been a slave in his house."<br>
"You are not a slave now."<br>
"No, I am your freed-man now. It is strange. I never thought of that until this evening."<br>
Marcus had never thought of it either, but he knew that it was true. You could give a slave his freedom, but nothing could undo the fact that he had been a slave; and between him; a freed-man, and any free man who had never been unfree, there would still be a difference. Wherever the Roman way of life held good, that difference would be there. That was why it had not mattered, all these months that they had been away; that was why it mattered now. Suddenly he felt baffled and helpless. "You did not feel like this before we went North. How is it altered now?"<br>
"That was at the beginning. I had not had time to--understand. I knew only that I was free--a hound slipped from the leash; and we were going away from it all in the morning. Now we have come back."<br>
Yes, they had come back, and the thing had got to be faced, and faced at once. On a sudden impulse Marcus reached out his free hand and caught his friend's shoulder, not at all gently. "Listen to me," he said. "Are you going to live all the rest of your life as though you had taken a whipping and could not forget it? Because if you are, I am sorry for you. You don't like being a freed-man, do you? Well, I don't like being lame[disabled]. That makes two of us, and the only thing we can do about it, you and I, is to learn to carry the scars lightly." He gave the shoulder a friendly shake, and dropped his hand. "Come up with me now, Esca."<br>
Esca did not answer for a moment. And then slowly his head went up, and his eyes wore the dancing look they always wore in action. "I will come," he said.

Marcus: I suppose I should feel guilty about you, Esca. For me, there has been the Eagle; but what had you to win in all this?<br>
Esca: I have been once again a free man amongst free men. I have shared the hunting with my brother, and it has been a good hunting.<br>
Marcus smiled back. "It has been a good hunting," he agreed... They would be here soon, but the riders from below would be first. "A good hunting; and now I think that is ended." He wondered if any word of that ending would one day drift south across the Wall, would reach the Legate Claudius, and through him, Uncle Aquila; would reach Cottia in the garden under the sheltering ramparts of Calleva. He should like them to know... it had been a good hunting, that he and Esca had had together. Suddenly he knew that, despite all outward seeming, it had been worth while.

Marcus: Let me look. What is this you have been putting in the child's eyes?<br>
Old man: Toad's fat. With my own hands I salved them, though it is women's work, for my grandson's wife is a fool.<br>
Marcus: Have you found it do any good?<br>
Old man: Maybe not.<br>
Marcus: Then why use it?<br>
Old man: It is the custom. Always our womenfolk put toad's fat on such places; but my grandson's wife-- but all along, I have said the child will be blind.<br>
Marcus heard the girl behind him catch her breath in agonized protest, and felt his own temper flash up in him, but had the sense to know that if he made an enemy of the old devil he might as well give up any hope of saving the child's sight. So he said peaceably enough, "We will see. Toad's fat is doubtless good for sore eyes, but since it has failed, this time, I shall try my own salves [medicine]; and it may be that they will do better. Bring me warm water and linen rags... Esca, do you bring in my medicine box."

Yet nowhere could Marcus hear any whisper of the lost Eagle. These people did not speak of their gods, nor of the things which had to do with their gods. And suddenly, this evening looking out over the shining sea, Marcus was heart-sick and not far from giving up hope.

Lastly, [Marcus] took from the breast of his tunic his olive-wood bird--his olive-wood bird. It was polished smooth and dark with years of carrying; rather a clumsy and ridiculous little bird, now that he came to look at it, but dear to him; and its dearness made it a fitting sacrifice. It had been part of his life, something that continued back from him to the wild olive tree in the loop of the stream, and the life and places and things and people that the wild olive tree belonged to. And suddenly, as he laid it in the hollow among the tiny stars of the rowan blossom, it seemed to him that with it--in it-- he was laying the old life down too.

Marcus: The details can wait awhile; but first you had best take this.<br>
And he held out a slim papyrus roll he had been carrying.<br>
Esca took it with a puzzled glance at his face, and unrolling it, he held it to the lamplight. And watching him, Marcus remembered suddenly and piercingly the moment that afternoon when he had taken off Cub's collar. Cub had come back to him; but Esca?<br>
Esca: Capitals are one thing, but I can make nothing of this cript. What is it?<br>
Marcus: Your manumission--your freedom. I made it out this evening, and Uncle Aquila and the Legate witnessed it. Esca, I ought to have given it to you long ago; I have been a completely unthinking fool, and I am sorry.<br>
Esca: I am free? Free to go?<br>
Marcus: Yes. Free to go, Esca.<br>
Esca: Is it that you are sending me away?<br>
Marcus: No! It is for you to go, or stay, as you wish.<br>
Esca: Then I stay. It is perhaps not only I who think foolish thoughts because of the Tribute Placidus.<br>
Marcus: Perhaps. Esca, I should never have asked you to come with me into this hazard when you were not free to refuse. It is like to prove a wild hunt, and whether or no we shall come back from it lies on the knees of the gods. No one should ask a slave to go with him on such a hunting trail; but-- he might ask a friend.<br>
Esca: I have not served the Centurion because I was his slave. I have served Marcus, and it was not slave-service... My stomach will be glad when we start on this hunting trail.

Marcus: Claudius, you said just now that had you had the right man among your young men, you would have sent him. Do I get my marching orders?<br>
It was [Marcus's] uncle who answered first, speaking to the Legate as much as to Marcus. "The gods of my fathers forbid that I should hold back any kinsman of mine from breaking his neck in a clean cause, if he has a mind to."... Marucs... realized that Uncle Aquila knew and understood very much more of what all this was meaning to him than he would somehow have expected.

The odd thing was that now he came to think of it he did need Cottia as much as ever; he often forgot her altogether with the surface of his mind, but he knew that if he were never to see her again he would be very unhappy, perhaps as unhappy as he would if Cub never came back...<br>
And would Cub ever come back? Would the call of his own kind prove stronger than the tie that bound him to his master? Either way, Marcus hoped that it would be quick and easy and final; no tearing of the heart in two, for Cub.

Marcus's [thoughts] were mainly concerned, as they had been for some time past, with the question of what he was going to do with himself and his life, now that he was well again. The Legions were closed to him, and that left just one other way of life that he would have turned to as a bird flies home. Farming was in the blood of most of his race...; and to Marcus, born and bred as he had been, farming and soldiering were yoke-mates, the two natural ways of life... He should have set about finding some way to earn his living before now, he supposed, but there were so few ways open to a free man, and the frightful conviction was growing on him that he would end up as somebody's secretary.

Cub[a pet wolf] was full grown now, though not yet come to his full strength, and the time had arrived when he must have his choice of returning to the wild. You could tame a wild thing, but never count it as truly won until, being free to return to its own kind, it chose to come back to you. Marcus had known that all along, and he and Esca had made their preparations with infinite care, bringing Cub to this spot again and again, that he might be sure of the way home if he wished to take it. If he wished to take it. With his fingers on the buckle, Marcus wondered whether he would ever feel the hairy living warmth of Cub's neck again.<br>
The collar was off now, and he thrust it into the breast of his tunic. For a lingering moment he fondled the pricked ears. Then he stood erect. "Go free, brother. Good hunting." Cub looked up into his face, puzzled; then, as a fresh burst of woodland smells reached his quivering nose, trotted off down the woodshore.<br>
The other two watched him go in silence, a brindled shadow slipping away into the undergrowth. Then Marcus turned and made for the trunk of a fallen birch tree a little way down the slope, moving quickly but awkwardly over the rough ground with a sideways lurch of the shoulders at every step. Rufrius Galarius had done his work well, and now, some eight months later, Marcus was to all intents and purposes as sound as ever, just as the surgeon had promised. He would carry the scars to his dying day, and a twisted leg that would bar him from the Legions, but that was all; indeed, after a winter spent with Esca's help in training as though for the arena, he was now as hard as a gladiator.

[Marcus] was still unpleasantly cold in the pit of his stomach, but he no longer felt alone. In some way that he did not understand, Cub and Esca and Cottia had comforted and steadied him for what was coming.<br>
... There had been the day that Cub [a pet baby wolf] discovered how to bark. Marcus had been as surprised as Cub. "But wolves never bark," he said to Esca; and Esca had said: "Rear in a wolf with the dog-pack and he will do as the dog-pack does in all things."<br>
...A kind summer, a kingfisher summer, and suddenly he was grateful for it.

Marcus: And what is it that you suppose you are doing here, my Lady?<br>
Cottia: Why did you not tell me?<br>

Cottia: About the Healer with the Knife. I saw him come... and Nissa told me why he came.<br>
Marcus: I did not mean that you should know until it [the surgery] was all over and done with.<br>
Cottia: ...What will he do to you?<br>
Marcus: I am to have the wound cleaned up. That is all.<br>
Cottia: ... I wish it could be me instead.<br>
It was a thing more easily said than meant, but Cottia did mean it. Looking at her, Marcus knew that. "Thank you, Cottia. I shall remember that. And now you must go home."

Rufrius Galarius: We were great hunters, your uncle [Aquila] and I; and now we grow stiff in our joints and set in our ways. Sometimes I think I will pack up and go on my travels again, before it is too late and I am utterly rusted into my socket. But I chose the wrong branch of my calling for that. A surgeon's craft is none so easily picked up and carried about the world. An oculist's, now, that is the craft for a follower of Aesculapius with the itch to wander! Here in the North, where so many have the marsh-blindness, an oculist's stamp is a talisman to carry a man safely where a Legion could not go.<br>
And [Rufius] launched out into an account of the adventures of an acquaintance who had crossed the Western Ocean and plied his trade through the wilds of Hibernia, a few years before, while Marcus listened with about half his attention, little guessing that the time was to come when that story would be tremendously important to him.

Uncle Aquila: Why do you want [Cottia] to come?<br>
Marcus: Oh--because she and Cub understand each other.<br>
Uncle Aquila: And so I am to be thrown to the lions in order that Cub may have his playmate?<br>
Marcus: It is only one lion, or rather lioness[speaking of Lady Valaria]. Uncle Aquila, we do need your help... It is a job for the head of the household.<br>
Uncle Aquila: It was peaceful in this house before you came. You are an unutterable nuisance, but I suppose you must have your own way.<br>
Marcus was never quite sure how it was brought about. Certainly Uncle Aquila never appeared to bestir himself at all in the matter, but from that time forward there began to be more of surface friendliness between the two houses, and before the woods below the old ramparts had thickened into full leaf, Cottia had become a part of life in the Aquila household, and came and went as it pleased her, and as it pleased Marcus.

Marcus had said, "Come when you like," and Cottia had said, "I will come tomorrow." But it was not so simple as that, after all... Aunt Valaria, always so careful to follow the custom of what she called "civilized society," was very sure that it was not the custom for gently nurtured Roman maidens to take themselves into other people's gardens and make friends with the total strangers they found there. It was not as though Aquila had ever shown himself in the least friendly.

Marcus: Esca, why do all the frontier tribes resent our coming so bitterly? The tribes of the South have taken to our ways easily enough.<br>
Esca: We have ways of our own. The tribes of the South had lost their birthright before ever the Eagles came in war. They sold it for the things that Rome could give. They were fat with Roman merchandise and their souls had grown lazy within them.<br>
Marcus: But these things that Rome had to give, are they not good things? Justice, and order, and good roads; worth having, surely?<br>
Esca: These be all good things. But the price is too high.<br>
Marcus: The price? Freedom?<br>
Esca: Yes-- and other things than freedom.<br>
Marcus: What other things? Tell me, Esca; I want to know. I want to understand.<br>
Esca: Look at the pattern embossed here on your dagger-sheath. See, here is a tight curve, and here is another facing the other way to balance it, and here between them is a little round stiff flower; and then it is all repeated here, and here, and here again. It is beautiful, yes, but to me it is as meaningless as an unlit lamp.<br>
Marcus: Go on.<br>
Esca: Look now at this shield-boss. See the bulging curves that flow from each other as water flows from water and wind from wind, as the stars turn in the heaven and bloown sand drifts into dunes. These are the curves of life; and the man who traced them had in him knowledge of things that your people have lost the key to--if they ever had it. You cannot expect the man who made this shield to live easily under the rule of the man who worked the sheath of this dagger.<br>
Marcus: The sheath was made by a British craftsman. I brought it at Anderida when I first landed.<br>
Esca: By a British craftsman, yes, making a Roman pattern. One who had lived so long under the wings of Rome--he and his fathers before him--that he had forgotten the ways and the spirit of his own people. You are the builders of coursed stone walls, the makers of straight roads and ordered justice and disciplined troops. We know that, we know it all too well. We know that your justice is more sure than ours, and when we rise against you, we see our hosts break against the discipline of your troops, as the sea breaks against a rock. And we do not understand, because all these things are of the ordered pattern, and only the free curves of the shield-boss are real to us. We do not understand. And when the time comes that we begin to understand your world, too often we lose the understanding of our own.<br>
Marcus: When I came out from home, a year and a half ago, it all seemed so simple.<br>
His gaze dropped again to the buckler on the bench beside him, seeing the strange, swelling curves of the boss with new eyes. Esca had chosen his symbol well, he thought: between the formal pattern on his dagger-sheath and the formless yet potent beauty of the shield-boss lay all the distance that could lie between two worlds. And yet between individual people, people like Esca, and Marcus, and Cottia, the distance narrowed so that you could reach across it, one to another, so that it ceased to matter.

Cottia's changeable face was suddenly as vixenish as he had guessed it could be. "Only I hate living with my aunt; I hate living in a town full of straight lines, and being shut up inside brike walls, and being called Camilla; and I hate--hate--hate it when they try to make me pretend to be a Roman maiden and forget my own tribe and my own father!"<br>
... "I like being inside your cloak," [Cottia] said contentedly. "It feels warm and safe, as a bird must feel inside its own feathers."

But it was none of these things Marcus saw, only the look in the wide-set grey eyes that strained back at him out of the gladiator's young sullen face.<br>
This man is afraid, said something deep in Marcus. Afraid--afraid, and his own stomach cringed within him.<br>
... He was wondering for the first time-- he had not thought to wonder before--why the fate of a slave gladiator he had never before set eyes on should matter to him so nearly. But it did matter. Maybe it was like calling to like; and yet it was hard to see quite what he had in common with a barbarian slave.

That was when they told [Marcus] that his service with the Eagles was over.<br>
... It was the thing that Marucs had been afraid of ever since his interview with Centurion Maximum. No need to be afraid now, not anymore. He took it very quietly; but it meant the loss of almost everything he ever thought of, the only kind that he had any training for; and now it was over. He would never be Prefect of an Egyptian Legion, he would never be able to buy back the farm in the Etruscan hills, or gather to himself another like it. The Legion was lost to him and, with the Legion, it seemed that his own land was lost to him too; and the future, with a lame leg and no money and no prospects, seemed at first sight rather bleak and terrifying.

Looking back across the years, Marcus remembered that his father's eyes had been very bright, like the eyes of a man going into action; and the light had caught suddenly in the great flawed emerald of the signet-ring he always wore, striking from it a spark of clear green fire. Odd how one remembered things like that: little things that somehow mattered.

His mother had died soon afterword, leaving him to be brought up in Rome by a rather foolish aunt and the plump and purse-proud official who was her husband.

Marcus came of a line of soldiers... had kept to the old way of life, and remained poor but held their noses high in consequence. The official came of a line of officials, and his code of life was quite other than Marcus's.

Playwright: Write down your biggest fear.<br>
... When I was a kid I used to expect to win tournaments and often did, but I stopped having expectations about achieving anything long ago.<br>
"I have no fears today," I scribble, fold it up and drop it in. I'm stunned by the truth of it.<br>
Playwright: All problems with writing and performing come from fear. Fear of exposure, fear of weakness, fear of lack of talent, fear of looking like a fool for trying, for even thinking you could write in the first place. It's all fear. If we didn't have fear, imagine the creativity in the world. Fear holds us back every step of the way. A lot of studies say that despite all our fears in this country--death, war, guns, illness-- our biggest fear is public speaking. What I am doing right now. And when people are asked to identify which kind of public speaking they are most afraid of, they check the improvisation box. So improvisation is the number-one fear in America. Forget a nuclear winter or an eight point nine earthquake or another Hitler. It's improv. Which is funny, because aren't we just improvising all day long? Isn't our whole life just one long improvisation? What are we so scared of?

[Introducing the writing festival at the high school]<br>
I tell them the truth. I tell them I am thirty-one years old and seventy-three thousand dollars in debt. I tell them that since college I've moved eleven times, had seventeen jobs and several relationships that didn't work out. I've been estranged from my father since twelfth grade, and earlier this year my mother died. My only sibling lives three thousand miles away. What I have had for the past six years, what has been constant and steady in my life is the novel I've been writing. This has been my home, the place I could always retreat to. The place I could sometimes even feel powerful, I tell them. The place where I am most myself. Maybe some of you, I tell them, have found this place already. Maybe some of you will find it years from now. My hope is that some of you will find it for the first time today by writing.<br>
... Once we hae our details-- our white-hot places of experience he calls them-- we have to choose one and write about it. "Not in sentences but in bursts of feelings-- phrases, words, don't worry how they relate just get them out. You are vomiting here."<br>

I think about that time in high school when I was scared of killing myself in my sleep and I wonder if there is some part of me now that wants to die, wants to hoist the white flag and admit defeat. What if my body is done trying to make things work? What if it doesn't want what I want? I stop and stare at a strip of grass between the sidewalk and the street, the slender trunk of a small bare tree. What if this is all the life I get?<br>
...Doctor: Where is it? [He's in a hurry. People are waiting. People are dying.]<br>
Casey: Here.<br>
Doctor: That's a lymph node. Regular size. [Not cancerous].<br>
Casey: But I can't find it on the other side.<br>
Doctor: Exit is to the left.<br>
... I wait for [my friends] outside in the sun. I didn't know it was sunny. Everything feels so much clearer, like I've gotten glasses. Above us is one thick square cloud that looks cut from marble. Traffic whips by. "It's nothing," I tell them. "It's normal."

[Playing chess scene]<br>
[Silas] takes my other rook with his queen. "Check."<br>
I move my king up a square. It's all over. He's got his bishop and his queen after me, and I've got no one.<br>
...I study the board. i see why he feels threatened. I move my knight and take his pawn. "Check."<br>
...Casey: Checkmate. Checkmate!<br>
... 'How did that happen?' I look at all the pieces I lost at the side of the table, two pawns, two rooks, a bishop, and a queen. 'How did he do that?'<br>
'He didn't need them. He just had the guts to keep fighting.'<br>
'I do feel kind of immortal now.'<br>
He laughs. He looks happy and doesn't try to hide it.

I tell [Silas] I got fired, and he's so sympathetic about it that I tell him about the lump and the bees and the no sleeping and the revision I can't write. I tell him about the interview and the math band and how I'd blown it by feeling too comfortable and how bizarre it was that I actually wanted to stay for lunch... [Silas] gathers up all our trash and throws it out and when he comes back I assume he's going to say he has to go, but he sits back down with both hands on the table now, close to mine.<br>
Silas: Remember when I asked you out then left town? It was because everything felt like it was coming loose and I'd have to get up and walk around the city at two in the morning. I couldn't stop walking. I felt like if I stopped walking I'd die. All last summer I kept packig my bags and not leaving. Then I met you, and I knew I couldn't go out with you until I felt more normal. So I finally took off.<br>
Casey: I don't have a Crested Butte.<br>
Silas: You have something.<br>
Casey: It's more like an abyss.<br>
Silas: Something you need to get to.<br>
Casey: Yeah. The rest of my life. It feels like the way is blocked.<br>
...Casey: I've really lost my cammin (Italian?).<br>
Silas: We all lose our cammin.<br>
Casey: It's so physical. It feels like my body is rejecting me.<br>
He nods like he really knows what I mean. "Have you tried, you know, concentrating on the top of your head then your forehead then--"<br>
Casey: It just makes it worse. The only thing that helps is clenchig.<br>
Silas: Clenching?<br>
I lift up my arm and squeeze my right fist. I count to ten and release it. I raise my left fist and squeeze and he copies me. I release and he releases. We do many muscles ths way, arms, stomach, legs, feet. The last thing I show him are the face muscles, squeezing everything tight shut then opening our eyes and mouth wide. We look like crazed demons guarding a temple.<br>
Afterword things feel smoother.<br>
Silas: That's good. I feel like I'm floating... I have this book about famous chess matches, and sometimes I play them. My version of clenching. Escaping into someone else's mind for a little while.

[High School principal interviewer]: What is amusing you<br>
Casey. Oh. [I can't think of anything to say but the truth.] I was just thinking about this book that has a wing chair in it.<br>
Interviewer: Which book?<br>
Casey: Woodcutters. By Thomas Bernhard... most of it takes place in this wing chair in Vienna.<br>
Interviewer: The book takes place in a chair?<br>
Casey: The narrator has gone to what he calls an artistic dinner at the house of old friends who disillusioned him when he was younger. He hasn't seen them in thirty years, and he sits in this chair by the door and ruminates about them and their artistic dinners. There are no chapters or paragraphs. It's just his thoughts, which are punctuated by the phrase 'as I sat in my wing chair.'... Many times a page. He's there because a mutual friend committed suicide and they've just been to her funeral and it's really a book about art and becoming an artist and all the ways it ruins people, actually.<br>
Interviewer: How did it ruin her, the friend who committed suicide?<br>
I like the way she seems truly interested in this fictional world, as if it matters, as if she has all the time for it before she starts grilling me about my teaching background. "According to the narrator, she started out as an actress and a dancer, but she met a tapestry artist and married him and channeled all her dreams of artistic greatness and international fame into him, he who would never have pursued it without her driving him on. And she succeeded. As he became more and more renowned, she became more and more miserable, and yet he was actually her work of art, so she kept having to work at it, and eventually she self-destructs. At least that's what I think it's about, as I sit in my wing chair."<br>
...And talking about characters in books is exciting and soothing to me at the same time.<br>
Interviewer: Have you always been such an enthusiastic reader?<br>
Casey: Not really. I liked reading, but I was picky about books. I think the enthusiasm came when I started writing. Then I understood how hard it is to re-create in words what you see and feel in your head. That's what I love about Bernhard in the book. He manages to simulate consciousness, and it's conagious because while you're reading it rubs off on you and your mind starts working like that for a while. I love that. That reverberation for me is what is most important about literature. Not themes or symbols or the rest of that crap they teach in high school.<br>
Interviewer: How would you do it differently in your English class?<br>
Casey: I would want kids to talk and write about how the book makes them feel, what it reminded them of, if it changed their thoughts about anything. I'd have them keep a journal and have them freewrite after they read each assignment. What did this make you think about? That's what I'd want to know. I think youcould get some really original ideas that way, not the old regurgitated ones like man versus nature. Just shoot me if I ever assign ayone an essay about man versus nature. Questions like that are designed to pull you completely out of the story. Why would you want to pull kids out of the story? You want to push them further in, so they can feel everything the author tried so hard to create for them.<br>
Interviewer: But don't you think there are larger issues the author is trying to explore?<br>
Casey: Yes, but they shouldn't be given primacy over or even separated from the experience of the story itself. An author is trying to give you an immersive adventure.<br>
Interviewer: The only trouble with your pedagogy is that our students have to sit for the SAT and the AP, and they would have to have some familiarity with those literary devices.<br>
Casey: Of course. [It's over, I think in my wing chair.]<br>
...The only Hemingway I'd ever assign is The Sun Also Rises and only really for that passage where he goes into the church and prays for everybody and himself twice and wishes he felt religious and comes out into the hot sun on the steps of the cathedral with his fingers and thumb still damp and he feels them dry in the sun. I love that part so much.

Oscar: Of course they did. She was their mother. I was the dispensable one, the jerk who was always trying to get more time alone with his work. But there was this moment toward the end when I was hugging them on this terrible chair in her hospital room and I felt them turn fully toward me, like they knew it was over and it was just the three of us. It was awful and terrifying and heartbreaking, but it was exhilarating, too. I finally had their full attention. I like having people's full attention.

All [my mother's neighbors] had crushes on [my mother], but she was done with men. They'd come by with cuttings and compost in the spring, bulbs in the fall. They'd linger, ask about her goliath tomatoes or her trumpet vines. "I think my husband was half in love with her," more than a few women told me at her funeral. But they were not threatened. They loved her, too. They told me stories about how she cared for them during a hip replacement, a car accident, a son's suicide. How she slept on their couches and cooked meals and ran errands. How she fought the town on pesticides on school property and wrote letters to the editor about gay rights and racial justice. I kick through the leaves. Someone reminded me of her recently. I feel the memory, just out of reach, sweet, as if memory has flavors, a woman about her age. I can't remember. My mother was a real person. I am not a real person. She had convictions and took action. She had purpose and belief. She helped others. I help no one. She helped found that donation organization. I couldn't even write one thank-you letter for a refrigerator. All I want is to write fiction. I am a drain on the system, dragging around my debts and dreams. It's all I've wanted. And now I'm not even able to do that. I haven't been able to go near my book since I spoke to Jennifer Lin.<br>
... I crouch beside the tree trunk and stay still though everything inside me is churning. The ground benath the leaves is warm, but the air is cold. Something flashes in front of me. It's my breath. I can see my breath. It's been a long time since I've lived in a place where I can see my breath.<br>
... I can't go inside until I slow down. My heart and mind feel like they are in a race to the death. I watch my breath. I squeeze my muscles one by one. It's Star of Ashtabula who reminds me of my mother.<br>
I go inside and lie on my futon and wait to explode.

I don't want to walk down the driveway and out to the street. I'm scared I won't come back. I'm scared I'll burst or dissolve or veer straight into traffic. I'm scared of men at this time of night when I'm on foot, not on my bike. I'm scared of men in cars and men in doorways, men in groups and men alone. They are menacing. Men-acing. Men-dacious. Men-tal. I'm outside now. I'm circling the big tree. You hate men, paco said once. Do I? I don't like working for them. Marcus and Gory. Gabriel at Salvatore's was an exception. My French teacher in eighth grade rubbed my neck during a makeup test, swaying hard against the back of my plastic chair. I actually thought he had an itch. And when I asked Mr. Tuck at the airport in Madrid why he hadn't told someone about my father he said, I liked your dad but you know what happens to the messenger. I hate male cowardice and the way they always have each other's backs. They have no control. They justify everything their dicks make them do. And they get away with it. Nearly every time. My father peered through a hole at girls, possibly at me, in our locker room. And when he got caught, he got a party and a cake.

"Get your fucking hands off me." My voice is very loud, much louder than I expect, louder than any Krok or Whiffenpoof. I move quickly through the silent dining room out to the fire escape.<br>

I pore over the Globe classifieds for an apartment. I call about the smallest, cheapest ones, and they are already taken. Finally, I find one I can go and see... a basement studio in a yellow Victorian. The landlord is surprised by how captivated I am by it. I stand at the stove for a long time. A real gas stove. I turn on and off each gas burner. And the fridge is enormous. He laughs at my awe and says it's standard size... Off the back, through sliding glass doors, is a private patio encircled by flower beds and a crab apple tree. It's more than I can bear.<br>

There, on top of a stack of papers, is a story called 'Star of Ashtabula.' It's been typed on a manual typewriter so it has a faded, irregular look to it. Silas's name and address are in the top left corner. I shut the door.<br>
...I bring it to the couch. Star is a woman trying to save an old tree from being chopped down in the town center. She goes door-to-door to a series of oddball neighbors, and when the men with a backhoe come there is a protest with all the people she has mustered, awkwardly holding hands around the big tree. It turns out Star's ex-husband proposed to her under the tree, extemporaneously, with few words and no ring. She hadn't liked the proposal at the time and made him do it again properly a week later by the lake with a diamond and a dozen roses, but it is the first proposal benath the strong branches of that tree that she remembers and that moves her, years after they have divorced, at unexpected moments of the day.<br>
... It seems like it was written in a rush of feeling, as if the writer were determined to follow the emotion no matter how roughhewn the prose. There is something raw and uneven about it that people would try to fix.

Nearly every guy I've dated believed they should already be famous, believed that greatness was their destiny and they were already behind schedule. An early moment of intimacy often involved a confession of this sort: a childhood vision, teacher's prophesy, a genius IQ. At first, with my boyfriend in college, I believed it, too. Later, I thought I was just choosing delusional men. Now I understand it's how boys are raised to think, how they are lured into adulthood. I've met ambitious women, driven women, but no woman has ever told me that greatness was her destiny.<br>

Once Clark[angry chef] starts working nights, more bees swarm into my work life. I start getting customers confused, my orders mixed up. I have to take long breaks on the fire escape. My whole body feels like it's a big iron bell that someone has struck, and it won't stop ringing. It's like not being able to catch my breath except that I can't catch any part of me. Muriel tells me to take long slow breaths and scan my body from head to toe when this happens, but I end up gasping for air. Out on the fire escape I do some clenching. It's the only thing that helps. I clench my fists or press my knees together or squeeze my stomach muscles all at once. Sometimes I start with my face and work down my whole body, tightening each muscle one by one for as long as I can stand it, then letting go and moving on to the next. It's enough to get me back into the dining room... Sometimes, standing over a six-top and reciting the specials, I feel like I'm breaking up in tiny fragments, and I don't understand how phrases like 'with a cranberry cognac glaze' are still coming out of my mouth or why my customers watching me don't signal to someone that I need help. There's some thin covering over me that hides it all. If someone saw inside and called an ambulence, I would go off willingly. It's my biggest fantasy at these terrifying moments, two EMTs in the doorway with a stretcher for me to lie down on.<br>
The next Saturday night is particularly bad. When it's over I tip out and settle up and leave as soon as I can. I don't even say goodbye to Harry. My body is ringing. I can't feel my fingers. The only way I know I'm still breathing is that I'm still moving. Outside the cold feels good. I want colder. I want ice and snow, something to numb the panic... Something awful rises up in me, and I have to get out. I have to get out. I have to get out of this body right now.<br>
I crouch down on the pavement and raw terror overtakes me. I don't know if I'm making sounds. I'm like that boy in second grade who had an epileptic fit on the classroom floor, shuddering like a machine, only it's all inside my head, everything in my mind juddering like a hydraulic drill that I cannot stop. There seems to be no way to survive it or to make it end.<br>
I don't know how long it lasts. Time frays. When the worst of it has passed I'm still crouched on the ground, my forehead pressed to my knee. I raise my head and see my backpack, house key, and wad of cash tips spread out all around me on the pavement. I stand up, worried that someone from Iris will come out and find me crumpled there. it takes me a while to unlock my bike. My body is still trembling, just like Toby Cadamonte's after his seizure.<br>
I pedal slowly home, spent, but when I lie down on the futon after a warm shower and some muscle squeezing I feel like my body has been plugged into an outlet. More slow breathing. More clenching.<br>
I try to pray. I kiss my mother's ring, and I pray for her, for her soul and for peace in her soul. I pray for my father and Ann and Caleb and Phil and Muriel and Harry. I pray for the earth and everyone on it. I pray we can all come together and live without fear. And at the end I pray for sleep. I beg to have back the ability to fall asleep. I was once so good at it. I pray hard and yet I'm aware that I have no sense of what or whom I am praying to. I went to church until my mother went to Phoenix, but I never believed the stories in church any more or less than I believed in Pinocchio or the Three Little Pigs.<br>
The panic feels loud as hell in my head, like being next to a speaker at a concert. I turn back on the light and try to read. The words remain words. I can't hear them. I can't lose myself in them. A friend in college once said that she didn't understand how people read for enjoyment. She couldn't see or feel anything beyond the words. They never transformed into anything else but the sound of her internal voice reciting sentences. She concluded she had no imagination whatsoever. I wonder if I'm losing my imagination. This fresh fear is ice-cold. never to be able to read or write again. But really, what does it matter? Two more rejection letters came this week.<br>
I spend the night that way, passing through layers of anxiety, humiliation, and despair. Somewhere close to dawn I lose some consciousness. It isn't sleep exactly, but I have to think of it as sleep because it's all I ever get anymore.<br>
... I pass the tall gray hospital with its stacked rows of windows. On the lower floors you can see flowers on some of the sills. Bless them, my heart seems to say. Bless them all. And my throat closes from the thought of people dying in those rooms and their loved ones losing them, and I have to stop running to suck in enough air.

Silas leaves me a message, then another, and I don't call back. I've made my choice. I'm done with the seesaw, the hot and cold, the guys who don't know or can't tell you what they want. I'm done with kissing that melts your bones followed by ten days of silence followed by a fucking pat on the arm at the T stop.<br>
... It's a sense of despair about writing itself, a sort of throwing up of hands, as if to say I'll put this down on the page but it's not what I really mean because what I really mean cannot be put into words. It creates a sort of drag on the narrative.<br>
...'I read Thunder Road(Oscar's novel).'
Oscar: Really? Heavens. My pulse is starting to race.<br>
Casey: I loved it.<br>
Oscar: Honestly?<br>
Casey: Yes, yes.<br>
I tell him all the scenes I admired and why, the small moments and gestures. He seems eager for this approval, and I exaggerate my initial responses. I don't mention I read the earlier books as well, because I'm not sure I can keep up this level of enthusiasm that long.<br>
He calls the boys and... he says, "She liked my book."

My first rejection letter arrives.<br>
"We don't feel it's the right fit for us," it says.<br>
"That agent didn't read it," Muriel says. "His assistant or intern read it. That's why it says 'we' and not 'I.'" We're at her apartment. She's made me a lovely sandwich, but I can't eat it. My appetite is dwindling, along with sleep. "When someone actually reads it, it will be a different story."<br>
I can't speak, and she gets up and hugs me. "You are going to sell that fucker. I promise you."<br>
I need to sell it. I need more money. A guy named Derek Spike from EdFund has gotten my work number and spoken to Marcus about seizing a portion of my wages. Marcus hung up on him. "Those dicks. They made my sister's life hell. I was smart not to go to college."<br>
I'm starting to think he was right.<br>
Adam wants to increase my rent... I ask if I could have until the new year at the old rate.<br>
"What makes you think you'll be able to afford it then?"<br>
"I finished my novel."<br>
"And?"<br>
"I sent it out to agents and if--"<br>
He knocks his head back and laughs hard.<br>
I call Caleb[her older brother who is friends with Adam] and rant. "Your friend lives in a fucking mansion and drives a fucking Mercedes-Benz, but he has to suddenly raise my rent?"<br>
...Caleb must have called Adam, because he meets me at the door the next morning when I come in for the dog.<br>
...I'm thinking he's reconsidered the rent hike. Instead he tells me he's decided to divide his property and sell the garage and the yard to the far side of it. He's evicting me.<br>
'When?'<br>
"We're going to list it in three weeks. You don't have to clean or anyting. Whoever buys it will tear it down. It's the land they'll be looking for."

After dinner we(Casey and Silas) walk to the T stop. Neither of us suggests anything more to prolong the date. I follow him down the steps and through the turnstiles. I'm headed inbound and he's going out. We stand where our sets of stairs break off to separate tracks... A train rattles through a tunnel. I want him to kiss me. If I talk about Oscar, he won't kiss me.<br>
'I better get this.' He bats me lightly on the arm. "See you." he takes the stairs two at a time and makes it through the doors before they close.<br>
I guess there was no need to say anything after all.

[Casey teaches the young boys how to shuffle/bridge cards.]<br>
I hand the deck to Jasper first, which makes John impatient and Jasper uneasy. He's used to John paving the way, going into the unknown ahead of him. The first few times I put my hands over his and we do it together, then I take mine away. His fingers barely span the length of the deck and the cards scissor sideways and the bridge snaps.<br>
'I can't.'<br>
'Try it again.'<br>
He tries.<br>
'I can't.'<br>
'You can. Again.'<br>
On the fifth try he does it. Splat and whoosh. 'Papa, watch. Watch!'<br>
Oscar comes and stands at the edge of the rug.<br>
After a few more attempts Jasper does it again. And again.<br>
...[John] doesn't let me do it with him, but after a few tries he gets it. They pass the deck back and forth, practicing, imprinting it, their small hands more sure each time...<br>

I try to write something new. It's bad and I stop after a few sentences. Even though I didn't feel it at the time, i got into a rhythm with the old novel. I knew those characters and how to write them. I heard their voices and I saw their gestures and anything else feels fake and stiff.

I thought once the book was out of my hands the bees would fly off and I could relax. But they are worse. All night I lie in the dark on my futon while they writhe beneath my skin. I try to soothe myself with thoughts of agents reading my manuscript, but my feelings about the novel start to shift. Soon any thought of it scalds me with shame. Six years and this is what I have to show for myself? I try to hold the whole thing in my head again and I can't. I think about the first few pages and panic blooms in my chest and spreads like fire to my extremities. I watch the clock run through its numbers until it is light.<br>
During the day I miss working on it. I've lost access to a world where my mother is a lttle girl reading in a window or twirling in fast circles on the street, her braids raised high off her back. Outside of those pages she is dead. There seems no end to the procession of things that make my mother feel more dead.

Usually a man in my life slows my work down, but it turns out two men give me fresh energy for the revision. The emotions get heightened. I give the reader more pleasure. In the margins Muriel has written, "Linger here" or "Let us feel this," and I try to stay and feel the moment and my understanding of it expands. Small unexpected things begin to thrum across the whole book. I feel like a conductor, finally able to hear all the instruments at once. I think back on all the rooms in all the cities and towns where I wrote the pieces of this book, all the doubt and days of failure but also that knot of stubbornness that's still inside me.<br>
I save the rape scene for last... it comes out of me in one sitting. I see it, hear it, taste it. It pulses out like a song that's been stuck in the back of my mind. When it's done I'm haunted by what I wrote for a few days, skittish on my bike going home at night.<br>

My mother told me once that I had a beautiful voice. I was singing along with Olivia Newton-John in the car, and I had been trying to get her to say that. I wasn't just absentmindedly singing. I'd been going for the compliment. My voice is nothing special, but when your mother tells you something about yourself, even if you've coaxed it out of her, it's hard not to always believe it.<br>
I sing to the geese. And I feel her. It's different from remembering her or yearning for her. I feel her near me. I don't know if she is the geese or the river or the sky or the moon. I don't know if she is outside of me or inside of me, but she is here. I feel her love for me. I feel my love reach her. A brief, easy exchange.

A few mornings later I get hit by a car. I was giving myself a pep talk while walking the dog. I'd had a few bad days of writing, and I was tempted to go back a chapter to fix it, but I could not. I just needed to move forward, get to the end. Painters, I told myself, though I know nothing about painting, don't start at one side of the canvas and work meticulously across to the other side. They create an underpainting, a base of shape, of light and dark. They find the composition slowly, layer after layer. This was only my first layer, I told myself as we turned the corner, the dog pulling toward something ahead, his nails loud on the sidwalk. It's not supposed to be good or complete. It's okay that it feels like a liquid not a solid, a vast and spreading goo I can't manage, I told myself. It's okay that I'm not sure what's next, that it might be something unexpected. I need to trust-- the leash snaps out of my hand and the dog bolts across the street after a squirrel and I bolt after him and slam into a silver sedan.

That week I make a few trips to the public library to research Cuba. Each time I end up in the biography stacks, reading about writers and their dead mothers.<br>
...D. H. Lawrence begged the doctor to give [his mother] an overdose of morphia to set her free, but the doctor refused. Lawrence did it himself. He wrote later, 'From the death of my mother, the world began to dissolve around me, beautiful, iridescent, but passing away substanceless. Till I almost dissolved away myself, and was very ill, when I was twenty-six. Then slowly the world came back: or I myself returned: but to another world.'<br>
After [Virginia Woolf's] mother died, her perceptions were more intense, she wrote later, 'as if a burning glass had been laid over what was shaded and dormant.' That summer she had her first breakdown. It lasted two years.

In college one of my best friends was a pyscho major and practice on me with the Minnesota personality test. She showed me the bar graph of my results. All the bars were in the medium size, normal range except two, which were much taller. One was for a category called Defensiveness to the Test. The other was for schizophrenia. I wondered if that tall schizophrenia bar had anything to do with why I tied those dry-cleaning bags in knots before bed that year my mother was gone, my suspicion that there was someone else inside me. I hadn't had that fear again, and I don't think I've ever exhibited any signs of that illness, but I did start writing fiction the year my mother was gone and maybe that's where I channeled my schizophrenic potential.

The hardest thing about writing is getting in every day, breaking through the membrane. The second-hardest thing is getting out. Sometimes I sink down too deep and come up too fast. Afterward I feel wide open and skinless. The whole world feels moist and pliable. When I get up from the desk I straighten the edges of everything. The rug needs to be perfectly aligned with the floorboards. My toothbrush needs to be perpendicular to the edge of the shelf. Clothing cannot be left inside out. My mother's sapphire needs to be centered on my finger.

Tara from middle school calls and puts me on the spot. She wants me to be her maid of honor. In November. In Italy. She knows my situation. I'm not sure why she's going through the motions of asking.<br>
Tara: I know what you're going to say. But It's going to be easy for you. I got a huge discount on the dresses so they're only three hundred... And we got a super deal on a villa outside of Rome. It's magnificent. Meals included. Only four hundred a night when it's normally like eight. And we bundled the plane tickets--business class. If you get them by the end of the week, it'll only be seven fifty.<br>
She's acting like she's not talking about dollars but something much easier to come by like hairs on my head, like I can just pluck them off and hand them to her.<br>
Casey: You have no idea how out of the realm that is for me.<br>
Tara: I need you there. You have to be there. This isn't a choice, Casey. You go to your best friend's wedding.<br>
Best friend? She's a good friend. She's an old friend...<br>
Casey: I would give anything to be there in that beautiful place watching you marry the man of your dreams. But I don't have eighteen hundred and fifty dollars. I don't even have a hundred and fifty dollars.<br>
Tara: Well, I can't pay your way. We're already giving a free ride to my sisters.<br>
Casey: That's not what I was angling for. I would never accept that.<br>
Tara: You have a job. We played phone tag for two weeks because of all the shifts you're working. What else are you going to spend this money on? This is one of those selfish decisions you are going to regret the rest of your life. We need to be there for each other. You need to make this happen against all odds and obstacles. You put it on a credit card, and you come to my wedding.<br>
Casey: I've maxed everything out. I can't accrue more debt. I can barely meet the minimums.<br>
Tara: Jeez, Casey. At some point, don't you think you have to grow up? You can't expect to be given a pass forever. It's time to be an adult. You can't live in your made-up worlds all your life. People get real jobs that make real money so that they can be a real friend at their best friend's wedding. I flew from my vacation in Bermuda to Arizona for your mother's funeral. And it wasn't cheap, buying it three days before. Did your mother have any idea how much trouble you were in?<br>
Casey: Did you pay for that ticket, Tara?<br>

[My father] had been on the minor league tours for nearly a decade, he told [my mother], and if he didn't qualify for the PGA that year, he was going to quit. My mother asked what he'd do then. 'Marry you,' he said.<br>
My mother told me he wooed her with wanderlust. He could teach golf anywhere. he was a better teacher than player, he confessed to her. They could spend a year or two in the south of France, Greece, Morocco. head over to Asia. There was a lot of interest in golf in Japan, he said. After that maybe Cuba would have opened up again. Maybe he could bring her back there to live, he told her. She quit college to marry him, but he surprised her after the honeymoon by buying a house north of Boston. He got a job at the high school, and they never left. Instead of love and the revolution, instead of traveling the world, she became a radical in our conservative town, distributing flyers and hiring vans to go to protests against discrimination, Vietnam, and nuclear power. Sometimes she and Caleb,[my older brother], were the only people in those vans.

My mother's friend Janet was with [my mother] at the clinic on the island. She wasn't struggling, Janet told me. She wasn't in pain. She was dozing. Sort of in and out. Then she sat up, said she had to make a phone call, lay back down again, and was dead. It was very peaceful, Janet told me. Such a pretty day.<br>
I tried, in phone calls with Janet, to get more detail than pretty day and peaceful. I wanted everything, my mother's exact words and the smell of the clinic and the color of the walls. Were children kicking a ball outside? Was she holding Janet's hand? Who did she sit up to call? Was there any noise at all when her heart stopped? Why did it stop? I wanted to hear my mother tell it. She loved a story. She loved a mystery. She could make any little incident intriguing. In her version, the doctor would have a wandering eye and three chickens in the back named after Tolstoy characters. Janet would have a heat rash on her neck. I wanter her and no one else to tell me the story of how she died.

Looking at the rest of his life scared him. But losing me, he said, was even scarier... We went around and around. For hours. He was so dramatic, leaping around me, throwing out his arms... I kept asking him why he didn't tell me all this before, and he said he didn't know. He cried. I've never seen him cry before, not actual tears. It was awful. I couldn't fake it, though. I couldn't even tell him I'd think about it. It was over. It was so clear. And when he tried to kiss me, I shoved him away. My arms just pushed him away before I knew what I was doing. It was so physical, the repulsion. It felt biological. Like I knew I would never have children with this man. It was so awful and weird.

With other people, people who haven't been through something like that, you feel the solid wall. Your words go scattershot off of it.<br>
I ask him, and he says his sister died, eight years ago.<br>
'I usually say it was a hiking accident,' he says. 'That she fell. But she was struck by lightning. People can get very caught up in that. The symbolism. Or the physical details. Either one. It bugs me.'<br>
'Where were you when you found out?' I don't know why, but I need to picture him at that moment. It's such an awful moment. I heard over the phone at five in the morning in a tiny kitchen in Spain.<br>
'I was home, at my parents' house. I was supposed to be on that trip but I'd gotten mono. That day was the first day I felt okay. I went to the mall to get a pair of sneakers, and when I came back my father told me to sit down. I said I didn't want to sit down. I heard it all in his voice. I already knew.

I look into my eyes, but they aren't really mine, not the eyes I used to have. They're the eyes of someone very tired and very sad, and once I see them I feel even sadder and then I see that sadness, that compassion, for the sadness in my eyes, and I see the water rising in them. I'm both the sad person and the person wanting to comfort the sad person. And then I feel sad for that person who has so much compassion because she's clearly been through the same thing, too. And the cycle keeps repeating.

I sublet a room in a house on Chauncy Street with friends, eighty dollars a month. We were all trying to be writers, with jobs that got us by. nia and Abby were working on novels, I was writing stories, and Russell was a poet. Of all of us, I would have bet that Russell would stick with it the longest. Rigid and disciplined, he got up at four thirty every morning, wrote until seven, and ran five miles before he went to work at Widener Library. But he was the first to surrender and go to law school. He's a tax attorney in Tampa now. Abby was next. Her aunt convinced her to take a realtor's exam, just on a lark. Later she tried to tell me she was still using her imagination when she walked through the houses and invented a new life for her clients. I saw her last month outside an enormous house with white columns in Brookline. She was leaning into the driver's window of a black SUV in the driveway and nodding profusely. Nia met a Milton scholar with excellent posture and a trust fund, who handed her novel back after reading fifteen pages, saying first-person female narratives grated on him. She chucked it in the dumpster, married him, andmoved to houston when he got a job at Rice.<br>

But right on the heels of that feeling, that suspicion that all is not yet lost, comes the urge to tell my mother, tell her that I am okay today, that I have felt something close to happiness, that I might still be capable of feeling happy. She will want to know that. But I can't tell her. That's the wall I always slam into on a good morning like this. My mother will be worrying about me, and I can't tell her that I'm okay.

Woman: Yes, he did. That's why I take flowers to his grave. That's all I can do for him now. He would appreciate the delicate beauty of their bloom even each blade of their grassy stems. No detail of life was too small or too humble for him. He appreciated and loved it all.

"Heart of the Matter" by Don Henley<br>
I thought of all the bad luck<br>
And the struggles we went through<br>
And how I lost me and you lost you<br>
<br>
What are those voices outside love's open door<br>
Make us throw off our contentment<br>
And beg for something more?<br>
...<br>
The more I know, the less I understand<br>
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning again<br>
<br>
I've been tryin' to get down<br>
To the heart of the matter but my will gets weak<br>
And my thoughts seem to scatter<br>
But I think it's about forgivenes, forgiveness<br>
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore<br>
...<br>
We all need a little tenderness<br>
How can love survive in such a graceless age?<br>
<br>
Ah, the trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness<br>
They're the very things we kill I guess<br>
Ohh, pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms<br>
And the work I put between us<br>
You know it doesn't keep me warm<br>
...<br>
There are people in your life who've come and gone<br>
They let you down, you know they hurt your pride<br>
You better put it all behind you baby, cause life goes on<br>
If you keep carrying that anger, it'll eat you up inside, baby

My summary on testing own beliefs and philosophy<br>
In philosophy, once a theory is created, it has to be put to a test. Is the theory still valid after the test. Thus, I need to challenge my own notions and beliefs in order to discard false beliefs or to hold on to them and this all leads to discovering the truth. So be willing to test my ideas and beliefs and be willing to have people test my ideas and beliefs and see if I can defend them, otherwise, strengthen them or change them if they are wrong. All to discover truth.

On being with Krista Tippett with Jason Reynolds<br>
Jason: What does it mean to be human? It's like being asked what's the meaning of life? For me, it means to be changing. It means to be evolving. That's the part of humanity that excites me the most, is that its malleable. It shifts, it changes, the ways of life can change at any given moment and we can adabt to said ways of life. I always talk about indoctrination. Human beings have been indoctrinated and so if we've been indoctrinated that means we can also make new doctrine and then be re-indoctrinated... Regarding anti-racism, there's no finish line. There's this idea that people are gonna read all the books and then all of a sudden they are going to be anti-racist. And what I'm saying is, and that's a very American thing that there are winners and losers, that there's a binary that we live in, a bifurcation when it comes to that which is a failure and that which is victorious. The truth of the matter is that it's about journeyman, journey-folk. Our job is be constantly pressing toward the thing, but that thing is ever elusive. And it's ever elusive because the world and humanity continue to evolve and because it continues to evolve the things that complicate our lives evolve with it and so we have to be vigilant to continue to figure out what the new version of this illness are so we can continue to tear down that house. But there is no end goal. And I think that's how humanity and anti-racism connect.<br>
Krista: Anti-racism is a muscle that has to be developed that is with us at every step of the journey.<br>
Jason: Anti-racism is simply the muscle that says humans are human. That's it. It's the one that says, "I love you because you are you." That's all. And it feels so simple. And that's why racism has been the greatest hoax plauged on humans, it's the greatest hoax ever. Because that element of "I love you because you are you" should be the most human thing we know. It should be a natural thing to say, "I love you because you remind me more of myself than not."<br>
Krista: I have a daughter who is in her mid-twenties and she's an artistic person. She writes. And she has said when she was quite young, "I want to write children's books that will help heal adults." Help the children too. But also help adults.

On being with Krista Tippett with Jason Reynolds<br>
Krista: I want to read you some lines from Dante Stuart. He wrote something... about black rage. He's a preacher and a pastor. Black rage in an anti-black world is a spiritual virtue. Rage shakes us out of our illusion that the world, as it is, is what God wants. Rage forces us to deal with the gross system of inequality, exploitation, and disrespect. Rage is the public cry for black dignity. It becomes the public expression of a theological truth that black lives matter to God.<br>
Jason: I'm with him... there's something theoretical and theological about rage and I think we try to raise our young people to avoid it and I think so many people are scared for so many reasons that they are raising young people to not feel their feelings to the fullest extent. And then, when those young people are 25, rage becomes reactionary rage, and not a conscious rage. Black folk have the right to have a conscious rage. A conscious rage. Baldwin always talked about it: if you're conscious in America, if you're a black person who is conscious in America, then you are basically living in a state of anger. It is a conscious and constant thing. The only thing I would add as an addendum is that if it's not a conscious rage, meaning if it is not a rage we can tap into, a rage that exists in the quiver of our lives along with the joy, then it can poison us and overtake us. It can become an illness. It can cause illness. So reactionary rage is a dangerous thing, but to be able to tap into a conscious rage, I think, is a gift. And I do believe that it is a virtue... One has to know how to wield it. I choose to put my rage into the energy of helping young people process the world around them. But it comes from a place of rage and that rage is connected to a love, a true love, an aching love that I want, that I have for young people to grow into the people who will push forward freedom and anti-racism in an equitable world. I think they have it. I think they want it in a way we've never seen before. Just the way they are thinking about saving the planet. Their environmental foresight does not stop with vegetation and atmospheric happenings of the space in which we live. I think it also has to do with all natural elements, including human beings. When they're talking about environmental change, I really do think it means they want to change the environment,literally shift the landscape, that does not exclude humanity... I say this often because I think it's important. Their generation is teased and ridiculed and criticized for being too empathetic, as if that's a bad thing. And all of us who tease them and ridicule them, they have somehow made our lives a little bit complicated and uncomfortable because now we have to watch what we say. We have to be careful of making other people feel small. And we're upset about it. What they are saying is, "we are trying to make an equitable world. We want to make a world where everyone feels safe and free." And we ridicule them for it. It's so strange.

On being with Krista Tippett with Jason Reynolds<br>
Jason: I've been researching viruses as of late and how they work in the body. And what is actually happening in the body. And racism fits the description. This idea that you can inject, that you can ingest something you don't know you're ingesting, that it can attach itself to you cellularly. It can attach to your cells. And then it can propogate. It can self-propagate and become multiple cells in your body. And then you can breathe, you can say something, you can do something, very passively do something, and because we can't always see it, it can then infect somebody else, enter into their bloodstream, attach itself to their cells, propogate within their bodies. And you can be walking around asymptomatic. As far as you think, nothing is the matter. Nothing is wrong. You think you're healthy. You're not coughing when you speak. And the reality of the matter is it's living in your body. It's attached to your cells. And then we talk about vaccinations. And well, vaccines always hurt. Anyone who ever had a flu shot, your arm hurts for a week. But often times, it's a necessary thing to do because what happens is with a vaccine is that you inject, you take in, a part of the virus itself. It then has to live in your body and attack. It basically creates a soldier wall, it creates soldiers in your body so that whenever a live version of the virus re-enters the body, the vaccine kicks into play and recognizes it as the virus and fights it off. So what I'm saying is in order for us to begin to deconstruct the ideas set forth six hundred years ago, the first thing we have to do is take in the reality of the virus. We have to take it in. We have to understand that it is real. It exists. So that we can recognize it.<br>
Krista: My colleague, Lucas Johnson, said something: the racism pandemic and the virus pandemic are similar in that you can't expect... if everyone around you is sick, you can't expect to live that way for long and get away with your health.<br>
Jason: It's true... If this(racism) is a problem within the (police) force, if that sickness is there at the root, in the gene, in the dna, and even if you came in for the right reasons, or you're a "good" cop. If you're a good cop, and I always say this to my friends who are police officers, if you are a "good" cop, and you do not hold "bad" cops accountable, then you are not a good cop. And you have been infected. Because if I'm going to be upstanding, especially around conversations around race, equity, and all the isms, then I have to be able to call out the people that I claim I'm doing this work with. If I don't call them out, then I am complicit... And I've dealt with this in other parts of my life. When it comes to misogny, if I am doing my best to undo, deconstruct, and work through a misogyny that I was given that was pressed upon me by the world and country that I was born into, which is a reality for us, then I have to also be ready to say the things to the people I am connected to when they do misogynistic things. And if I do not, if I do not, then for that day, I have failed to undo, no matter how much work I was doing that day to undo misogyny and sexism, that day was a day that I had the can and start again tomorrow. But we gotta be honest about these things. I want young people to grow up and be fortified, to have integrity.

Jason: The history is birthed out of the imagination. It[racism and slavery] literally was conjured up. Imagination is so powerful that it can set forth 400 or 500 years of something wrong which means that it could very well set forth 400 or 500 years of something right. That's the beauty of humanity. We just don't know it.<br>
Krista: We have to own that beauty.<br>
Jason: We do... My favorite James Baldwin quote is "The interior life is the real life. And the intangible dreams of a person may have a tangible effect on the world." It's basically saying what one can imagine, internally, what one can think about when nobody knows, when nobody is around, one's secrets, could shift human life. What an amazing thing to think about... The imagination is always present.

On being with Krista Tippett with Jason Reynolds<br>
Krista: I watched you give a speech and you talked about libraries as sacred places and librarians as architects. And what if libraries are warehouses where we build human libraries and that the questions kids have gets stored on the shelf and passed around and loaned out to others. And you talked about the reference desks we have in our heads... It feels essential to me. Do you know what I'm talking about?<br>
Jason: I do. It's interesting because nobody talks about that speech. Ultimately, I think my role for as long as I am in this plane and doing this work, my role will always be to figure out how to create fortitude in the minds, spirits, and bodies of young people. I'm trying to fortify them... We need young people to activate their imaginations. If they cannot, if they don't, if by the time by high school, your imagination is shot, we're in trouble, big time. But how does one keep an imagination fresh in a world that works double time to suck it away? How does one keep an imagination firing off when we live in a nation that is constantly vacuuming it from them? And I think the answer is one must live a curious life. One must have stacks and stacks and stacks of books on the inside of their bodies. And those books don't have to be the things that you've read. That's good too. But those books could be conversations... it could be about this time, taking the long way home and seeing what's around you that you've never seen because most of us, especially city-folk, we stay in our little quadrants, the 5 block radius, whereever the coffee shop is and the school and the church. But what if you were to walk the other way? What if you were able to explore the places around you? What if you were to speak to your neighbor? And to figure out how to strike up a conversation with a person you've never met? What if you were to try to walk into a situation free of pre-conceived notions, just once a day. Once a day, walk in and say, I don't know what's going to happen. And lets see. Let me give this person the benefit of the doubt to be a human.<br>
...Krista: Stepping out of our neighborhood.<br>
Jason: That's it... This is why I work with young people and love young people: they haven't complicated life yet. If you ask a young person, "What advice would you give a white person right now amidst all the things that are happening?" And a young person, especially a young black person would say, "Stop being racist." For them, it's like why are we complicating this conversation. Let's figure out the shortest distance between A and B is a straight line so lets just do the straight line way and say here's what you can do about being racist right now. It's on you to figure out what that means. But that's the answer.<br>
Krist: The simplicity that lies on the other side of complexity.<br>
Jason: That's what I'm searching for. Just talk to someone different because we underestimate what this does for the mind. We underestimate what this does for the imagination. And as long as imaginations are firing off, then libraries will continue to be filled... There was a question from the audience. She asked me, "Have you ever been to Senegal?" I said, "No." And she said, "Do you know any Sengalese people?" I said, "I do." She said, "You should ask them about what they say when whenever an elder has died in the community." And I said, "What do they say?" They say that "A library has burned." I didn't know this. Isn't that something? A library has burned.

Jason: I'd grown up in a home that challenged everything. My mother had no problem saying that "if something did not make sense, even if it was an ancient belief system,"" she had no problem saying "It doesn't make sense. We don't have to believe that." ...<br>
Krista: I see a thread. What you do with your writing. Yes, it's in this genre we call YA writing. It's for kids. But actually, what you do is cut through bullshit. You say it plain-- the absurdity of things.<br>
Jason: I don't know how else to do it. The way we brought up it was say the thing. No point in mincing words. Just say the thing. But if you're gonna say it, stand on your square. There's no time for you to say your truth with cowardice. You lean into the truth courageously. Now, if it's proven to be incorrect, then you change it. You accept that with humility and you adjust your way of thinking.

Backstory: Francis was shot in the eye by Peter's mom, Anne. Then Francis's daughter, Kate, married Peter and Peter became an alcoholic. Anne and Francis reconciled and Peter is recovering from his alcoholism. Francis cheated on Anne and they worked through the infedility and stayed together.<br>
And then [Francis, Kate's dad,] saw what he'd never seen before, which was that Peter[Kate's husband] was fine. And Kate[Francis's daughter] was fine. Lena [Francis's wife] was fine. And he, Francis Gleeson, was fine. And that all the things that had happened in their lives had not hurt them in any essential way, despite what they may have believed at times. He had not lost anything; he'd only gained. Was the same true for Peter? For Kate? Yes. And yes. Would they be somewhere more magnificen than this were it not for everything that had happened? Would their lives have been fuller and happier? Looking at them now, he diddn't see how it would be possible. For the very first time, he felt that Peter was his blood.<br>

[Backstory: Brian, Peter's dad, raised Peter up until some time in high school and moved away. Peter never saw him again. Then one day, Brian dies because of a health condition and in a part of his will, Brian sends photos to Francis, Kate's dad. Francis and Brian were partners back in the day on the police force.]<br>
[Francis, Kate's dad,] picked up the photo of Anne[Peter's mom], and turned to Peter. "[Brian (Peter's dad)] showed me this one in 1973. July. We were on patrol. [Brian] kept it in the lining of his hat." [Francis] touched the prayer card, and the photo of Brian and George[Brian's brother]. "These, too."<br> 
"This one he must have added later," [Francis] said, picking up the photos of Peter. Francis remembered Peter at that age: a weird kid, always sitting on the rocks out back with soldier figurines, whispering to himself as he made them battle each other. A weird kid, maybe, but [Peter's] father had loved [Peter], had tucked [Peter] into the lining of his hat so that he could look at him when his patrol car was idling, or when a day was hard, or maybe when he felt afraid.<br>
Peter: Why did [my father] send [these pictures] to you? And not to me?<br>
Francis: I don't know.<br>
Maybe he sent them to Francis because he believed Francis alone would know what the photos meant to him, and he would tell Peter. The young cops today probably kept all their photos on their phones, kept the linings of their hats empty.<br>
Or maybe Brian was saying he was sorry to Francis, for whatever part he played. Maybe he was saying he should have done something more, seeing how they'd been partners, once, for six sweltering weeks in the summer of 1973.<br>
Or maybe he was saying, simply, that he remembered. That he'd not forgotten, even from the distance of so many years and so many miles, that he'd had a different life, once.<br>
Or maybe he wasn't saying anything at all, but simply wanted to mail the photos to someone who wouldn't be upset by them because he didn't want to throw them away, not after their having protected him through all his tours. This slim-necked woman was the woman he'd married. And this boy was the boy he'd made with her. And maybe he had to get their images out of the house in case Suzie(Brian's girlfriend when he died) came in to rub cornstarch between his toes.

But [Peter] hadn't even had a ring. Why had [Kate] said yes [to marry him]? He always said he'd get her a nice ring one day, but he never had. She still wore that seventy-five-dollar band they bought on Bleecker Street. So he hadn't properly asked her, not really.<br>
If she'd married anyone else, that person would have planned the question as an event, would have presented her with a beautiful diamond. He wished he'd done that.<br>
Kate: So you don't regret marrying me, you just regret the way you asked? Oh, Peter, I can think of so many other things you should regret.<br>
Peter: Yeah. Probably.<br>
Casey: Hey. Come back. If you regret it so much, ask me now. Ask again. Properly, this time.<br>

Peter: Things are better now, they feel like they're getting better--don't they? But there might be more coming. This might be the least of it. Have you thought about that? We knew nothing about what it meant to grow up, to be partners, parents, all of it. Nothing. And maybe we still don't. Would you have said yes back then if you'd known?<br>

Kate: I'm sorry about everything that happened after, but if we hadn't snuck out that night, maybe we wouldn't be together now. Frankie and Molly [their children] wouldn't be here... I'm not sure it's a regret but there is something I have to tell you. Your mother... I spotted her years ago, when we were still in the city. Before we were married. And after. And a few times at the house... All those years when I thought you were better off without her maybe you could have used knowing that she was there. Maybe it would have made things easier for you. To know she hadn't forgotten about you, that she did care about you. Maybe if you'd known that she was out there fifteen, seventeen years ago, you wouldn't have ended up feeling so lost.<br>

[Peter] decided the only thing to do was be with her as much as he could. He started going up to bed at the same time as her again. On nights when she stayed up to study, he made tea and kept her company in the kitchen, reading the paper or preparing lessons. When she sat on the couch and tried to find something good on television, he sat next to her. She began looking at him again, sometimes just long enough to let him know that she knew exactly what he was doing. When he had to go through his boxes of old books to find something for his students, he brought the boxes upstairs and went through them in the kitchen.<br>
"If you tell me what you're looking for, I can help you," she said, and together they sat on the floor, legs splayed, and flipped through book after book.<br>
It wasn't that she didn't love him, he knew. It was that she loved him so much that it frightened her, loved him so much that she worried she might have to protect herself from it. He tried to let her know that he'd figured that out, finally, that there was no need to explain, but then he realized that she might not know it herself.

Yes, that night when she'd caught him downstairs in the dark, he'd lied[about not drinking alcohol]. But he was not his father. He was not his mother. He was himself, and it was taking longer than he expected to decide what being himself meant. It was taking more than thirty-three days [of being at a rehabilitation clinic for alcoholics].

It's not about studying, burying your head in a book. It's in our daily lives; it's now, living inside us. And he'd spend the rest of the year proving it.

[Peter] woke early now, helped get the kids out to school. She could see him trying, willing himself to health, to happiness, and felt a swell of love for him. As she showered, as she dressed, as she backed her car out of their driveway, she listed over and over the things that made her lucky. It was a trick her mother had taught her for when she was down, and until now it had always worked. She tried to make herself understand how it must feel for him to have been something for so long and then to not be allowed to be it anymore. But on other mornings, when his enthusiasm for domestic life showed signs of wear, she felt all that sympathy collapse and she wanted to turn on him and ask if he had any idea how great she was, how great the kids were, how there were a million people in the world who'd love to be standing exactly where he was standing.<br>
Kate: Was it really so important to you? Being a cop?<br>
Peter: You're harsh, Kate. Everyone says you're so strong, but what you are is harsh.<br>
Practical. Level-headed. Mentally sound. Not harsh.<br>
Blunt, maybe. Honest. Not harsh. How dare he.<br>
They went on like this for weeks, two steps forward, one step back... When they slept together now it was on a shore so distant from the one they'd set out from that Kate found herself looking over her shoulder, looking back att he blinking light of their beginning to compare over and over the way things were then and the way things were now. What used to be fluent between them felt incomprehensible lately, far more difficult to translate. But things are meant to change, Peter said. Because life changes and people change.

Natalie and Sara [Kate's older sisters] had gotten her something, too, but Francis[Kate's dad] couldn't remember what. The point seemed to be not the thing itself-- linens, maybe-- but a way to tell Kate that they were okay with it, that they understood why they'd been left out. And, that they accepted Peter[Kate's husband]. That they wouldn't object just because of who his mother was[Peter's mother shot Kate's dad]. They went to Macy's, and spent too much money on some useless thing, and had come home and wrapped it in silver and white ribbons and presented it to [Kate], as a way to say they'd love [Peter] since Kate loved him.

[Kate is driving Peter, her husband, to a therapy center for alcoholics.] Together, they were facing this thing and battling it, side by side. Next to her, fiddling with the radio, he seemed healtheir already, like the switch had already been flipped. They'd vowed to remain together through good times and bad, and now look at them. If these weren't bad times, what were they? And they were doing fine.<br>
Peter: So what happens when we get there?<br>
Kate: They'll assess you, decide whether you fit the criteria for detox, then when they decide you do, they admit you. A few days of detox and then you get to work. You come home to us in a few weeks.<br>
Peter: And then what?<br>
Kate: I don't know. But think of it as an opportunity. How many people get a chance to start over again? You decided to be a cop at twenty-two. Did you really think out all your options? Do you remember when you told me you'd decided? You'd never, not even once, mentioned becoming a cop before that day. Be a pastry chef. Be a librarian. No matter what you'll still be a husband, a father. Those are the main things anyway.<br>
Peter: You realize we'll have a lot less money coming in.<br>
Kate: Yeah, maybe. But more money or less money, none of it matters if you don't get your act together.<br>
Peter: For them[their kids]. They're great kids.<br>
Kate: For yourself, Peter. Not for them. Not for me. For you.<br>
Peter: Did you really think about leaving [me]? Do you think about it, I mean? It seems a little quick, don't you think? Considering everything.<br>
Kate: Quick? This has been going on for a very long time. You haven't been sitting where I've been sitting. And also, life goes more quickly now. Have you noticed that? Everything that used to move at a normal rate is moving father now.<br>
Peter: And you haven't been sitting where I've been sitting.<br>
Kate: No, I haven't.<br>
Peter: Okay.<br>
Kate: Okay.

Kate made all the calls [to a therapy center for alcoholics.] Once [Peter, Kate's husband,] said he was willing to go, she didn't want to waste one single second... When it was all arranged Kate said thank you, thank you so much, he'll leave right away. She felt euphoric. She had not been this happy in months. Now, finally, things were going to be better. The bills wouldn't arrive until he was healthy. They'd solved the problem together, as they always had, as they always would.

That morning, twelve weeks after accidentally discharging his weapon, he'd sat on the edge of Kate's side of the bed and told her she might be right, that he might have a problem, but if she could just bear with him for a little longer he was determined to get better. He told her he'd been thinking about it for a while, about a thing shed said a few weeks back: that not all problems looked the same, but that didn't mean they weren't problems. The things she'd been saying to him, the warnings she'd been giving him, it was possible she was right. It was still possible she was wrong, but it was also possible she was right.

Anne(talking to George): I want to thank you. For everything you did for Peter(Anne's son. George took in Peter and raised him in high school). It was an extraordinary thing you did, taking him in like that. I am very grateful to you.<br>
There, she said it, and right away she felt dizzy with the weight that had been lifted. Therapist after therapist had promised her that one day, when the time was right, this might be a thing that would be good to say, for herself as much as for anyone else, but she'd never really believed it until he walked through the door that afternoon. Until that hour, she never thought she'd have the chance. "We repeat what we don't repair," Dr. Abbasi had said to her once, and for so many years she'd taken the limited interpretation of that as pertaining only to herself, and figured she was safe since she'd have little chance to repeat her worst errors anyway, having no family left, no one to abandon and no one to drive away. But from the moment Kate's face appeared at her car window that night, she wondered if all that time she'd misunderstood the warning. That the "we" in the doctor's aphorism(one, admittedly, she'd rolled her eyes at when it was first delivered to her) was larger. "We" could include Peter, could include his children, all the people connected to Anne by invisible thread.<br>
George: It was my pleasure.

[Peter] knew exactly what [Kate] meant, but it was exhausting to think about it all the time, to drag the weight of their shared history around with them every minute of the day. They won. They were together. Why go over it again and again? Kate thought about their wedding day as a conclusion to something, where he thought about it as a beginning. Rising action versus falling action. They were reading different books.<br>
Peter: Behold. All your dreams have come true.<br>
And besides, if their marriage was a conclusion to something, what did that mean for every day that came after?
	</p>

	<p id="503">
From Ask Again, Yes by Mary Beth Keane<br>
Peter hadn't seen his mother since he was fifteen, but Kate had to believe that knowing one's child as a child meant always knowing what was most essential about them. Kate knew Peter better than anyone else in the world, but there was one person who knew him first.

There'd been a simple arithmetic to life, two and two equaled four. But slowly, as years went by and the kids got older, started school, [Kate] often couldn't make things compute. [Peter] was still sleeping beside her at night, unless he was on a midnight tour. They were still doing steak on Sundays, pizza on Fridays. They still walked the same routes around the house, doing the same things they'd always done, more or less, but lately she felt a poverty of something-- happiness, she supposed-- deep inside her ribs, the place where she used to feel her joy spill over. What they'd told each other when they got married was still true, at least for her. She wanted to work, come home to him, discuss their days, eat meals together, go to bed. She wanted to watch a movie on the weekend, maybe go for a long walk, maybe go out to dinner, maybe see friends. She wanted to be able to tell him anything and have him tell her everything. And there were some weeks, still, when they did just that. If they could do all those things and pay their bills and not dread going to work each morning, coming home each night, then that was a life. That was a great life, in Kate's view. What else could there be? If they reminded themselves that these small things were enough, she believed, then they'd always be okay. So that was part of their vows, all those years ago when they climbed the steps of city hall on a Tuesday morning, the first appointment of the day. They vowed to live simply and honestly and to always be kind to each other. To be partners.<br>
But ever since the math stopped adding up, Kate was constantly puzzling over a problem that was so abstract that it was like trying to pin down a fog.

Her job, most days, was to find the contours of an invisible universe and then map it for others to see. She performed forensic analysis on hair, fibers, body fluids, fingerprints, gunshot residue, fire accelerants, etc. On her best day, she found a whole story contained in the pull tab of a hoodie. Another day, she unlocked a riddle with one single strand of hair. So why couldn't she solve this problem, too?

Lucy: Take a look. [The hats are] yours. I never understood their appeal, really. I mean, for me, anyway. I look funny in them.<br>
"I doubt that," Casey said. Lilly Dache, the famous milliner, had written that every woman looked better in a hat. She just had to find the right one. Dache believed that wonderful things could happen to a woman wearing a hat-- get kissed, meet a new friend, at the minimum, avoid freckles.<br>
Lucy: Oh no, trust me. I know two things about me and fashion: I look lousy in hats and in the color green. My skin becomes lizardly.<br>
Casey: C'mon. You're silly. I don't see that at all.<br>
... Casey held up a photograph framed in marquetry wood of the two of them in front of the stop. They were almost strangers to her; she had never even met Hazel, but to be in this house so soon after Joseph's death, they felt like kin.<br>
...Casey: One second. You try [this hat.]<br>
Lucy: No, no. You're just like Hazel. She'd always make me do silly things.<br>

Unu's lips trembled. Even as a little girl, [Ella, Unu's cousin,] had this goodness. As children, they'd play during family vacations and she'd fix him snacks or get him cold compresses if he got hurt. Despite their five-year difference, she had always seemed like the older one. He had never wanted to look bad before her, but Ella would accept you. She'd never cast you out.<br>
...[Unu sobs violently] Ella: Honey, whatever it is, it will look different tomorrow. It's always worse at night. You need to rest.<br>
Ella knew this was true. The awful could be different the next day. A social worker at the hospital had told her after she had taken too many of the codeine pills that every day the pain would alter a little and somehow you'd manage just a bit better. "I promise, Unu. There isn't anything you can't face."<br>
Unu: I was evicted today. I lost everything.<br>
Ella: Then you'll stay here. You'll tell me everything in the morning. I'll go make your room right now. Do you want to sleep?<br>

Chet knew that the judge would take the existing custodial arrangements seriously... [the wife's] job was more like 40 hours a week maximum, whereas Ted could work anywhere from 60 to 120 hours a week... But it would be easy to argue that the wife relied on baby-sitting for 60 hours a week, which was likely the case since she'd have to incorporate transit time as well as work time.

[Ted's mom]: And what will you do when you don't love this one anymore? Will you get rid of her like bad fish and find someone else? Why do people in America care so much about sex? Love isn't sex.<br>
... Ted thought to say something, then refrained. He would let her say these things to him, because he could not explain what had ahppened with Delia. What he felt for her was stronger than what he had ever felt for another person. Delia was like home to him. Ella was the house on the hill he'd dreamed of buying. But he could never relax in her presence. Also, he'd come to see her niceness and mildness as unattractive. She seemed to have no needs or desires of her own. At a Fly Garden party the spring of his senior year, a psych major had said to him, "The wife you choose will be your personal and social mirror. She is how you see yourself," and he had held on to that through the years. When he met Ella, he felt he had to marry her because she was exactly the image he wanted reflected. She was well educated, well bred, and unimpeachably beautiful. But meeting Delia had changed what he wanted from a wife. Delia was a more accurate reflection, he realized. Ted loved her more honestly. He also didn't want to grow old with someone he wasn't in love with-- to have a good-looking life with manners covering their lack of romantic feelings. This was what Ted had reasoned out in the time after he'd left his wife. And last, he could afford the divorce... His new job had a guaranteed contract with far better terms and a bigger upside if there were more deals. There seemed to be no limit on how much he could earn... As it turned out, love was more important to him than he'd thought. He would let his mother yell all she wanted.

David: After the divorce is final. And the herpes. If I get it, and if it hurts, you'll have to take care of me.<br>

... Lately [Ella] was difficult to predict. Ella hadn't even wanted to come to the concert tonight.[David had] had to cajole a little, ask her to call the sitter to stay later; he'd told her that she needed to make room in her life for the beautiful things. And now she wanted to see his house.<br>

"They shouldn't be so suspicious, but isn't it marvelous in a way that they're proud of their creative ideas?" he asked. "That they think of what they made up as something subjectively and objectively valuable? They believe that their poems are good enough to steal." Ella nodded, thinking this was right. What was valuable in her life? If Ted took Irene away, she'd have nothing.

Isaac: [Telling the lawyer story.] The rabbi says yes to the marriage. So Sarah becomes my aunt. Another one who dropped off before I was born, but he says no to Irv on his lifelong wish to become a lawyer. The rabbi says, on reading Irv's letter and recognizing his excessive passion to become a lawyer, he has come to the conclusion that it would be a mistake. If a man loves his job far too much and has a lust for it, he will make that an idol and he would destroy his own life and his family's.<br>
Casey: So, what? Then take a job you hate?<br>
Isaac: No, he thinks you should tkae a job, and a job should be a job and not something that you could love more than God. So the rabbi writes to Irv and tells him to be a silver engraver. A job for which Irv would not feel great passion.<br>
Sabine: That's so crazy. I love my job. I feel so much passion for what I do.<br>
Isaac: Well, the rabbi would not like that, I guess. But so what? We're not Jewish. And you don't believe in God anyway, so what does it matter? Besides, it's just one rabbi's nutty idea. [Irv] died a happy man, though, my father said. Seven sons and two daughters. He was my father's favorite... I mean, I guess he was kind of a romantic guy. You know? My father said he knew no one smarter than his brother Irv. He did everything in an intense way. Maybe the rabbi understood that about him. Eh, what do I know?<br>
Sabine: I don't believe that stuff. It's all magic and voodoo, and I think you should just be a good person. And it's crazy to not let a person who wants to be a lawyer be a lawyer. That's a nice job where you could really help people... I want you to be happy, Casey. And I'm-- sorry. I'm sorry I never know how to help you in the right way. It's just that I don't know how to love. Without taking over.

Sabine: Life is filled with many complicated tasks, and no one, Casey, no one can do things alone. It's very slow going if you choose that path.<br>
Casey: You did things by yourself.<br>
Sabine: You couldn't be more wrong. No one person helped me. Many, many, many people helped me. The bookkeeper who gave me a discount on filing my first returns, the diner owner who let me have free breakfasts when I couldn't pay, manufacturers who gave me credit when I had no right to expect it-- so many, many people helped me. I can't even begin to remember all their names. Why do you think I help people who are having a hard time? It all goes around, little girl. That's the whole point of it, goddammit! Why must you be so stubborn?<br>
Casey: And why do you act as if poor people shouldn't have any choices? Must I always take what's offered? Must I always be grateful? Listen, Sabine. I need to try this thing. I need to know if I can make it as an investment banker, make real money, pay back my school loans. I need to see if I can do it on my own. On my terms. And I ddin't know that Columbia would make a big difference. All right? I didn't know how the world worked. I was full of shit. You were right. Good for you.

It was a relief to see [Isaac]. Isaac liked [Casey] and wanted nothing from her. Jay Currie[Casey's ex-fiance] used to call Sabine her fairy godmother, but it was really Isaac who felt like the godparent, not by what he gave her in terms of things or experiences, but by his acceptance of her. It was a form of wealth bestowed upon you when a good person took you in like that.<br>
... [Casey] had left her job as a desk sales assistant precisely because she was too old to run errands like this. Lately, she'd been feeling that her servitude to Sabine had gone on for too long. Even if Sabine handed her the retail empire of Sabine's for a fraction of its market value, the option she would expect in return was a binding indenture enforced by gratitude. How did you quantify that? Would she forever be delivering packages on the weekends, having meals with Sabine when she didn't feel like it, and canceling the wishes of loved ones if Sabine didn't approve of them?

At school, outside of classes, all she ever heard was this distillation of the truth: The whole point of business school for those specializing in finance was to get a summer associate position at an investment bank; at the end of the summer, you were supposed to score an offer to return to the Wall Street firm after graduation; in the beginning of your second year, you could even try to leverage your permanent offer into an upgrade if you were gutsy enough; if all went well, you started the big fat job upon graduation. With those jumbo bonus checks you earned postgraduation, you were supposed to pay off your student loans in two years-- the same number it took you to incur the aforesaid debt. Obviously, the only jobs that could help you reduce your debit line with this kind of speed were top investment banks in the only street that mattered. Of all the areas of specialty at Stern, Casey had chosen finance-- where the top money went.

She loved this poor girl plucked out of Queens and wanted her to have everything she had herself... In [Casey], Sabine spotted the wide flash of the creative, and she yearned to nurture that piece. A spectacular failure was better than safety. Sabine wanted individuals to honor their greatest ambitions. All superior things-- all things worth knowing, possessing, creating, and admiring, she'd observed-- had begun with vast, impractical wishes. She hated msallness of character. Sabine hated fear... There was no proof for this, but Sabine had made every decision in her life based on hunches.

On being with Krista Tippett with Isabel Wilkerson<br>
Isabel: That is the essential missing piece, which is empathy, empathy and recognition in the common humanity in another person... The need for radical empathy. Empathy is not pity or sympathy. Pity is you are looking down on someone and feeling sorry for them. Sympathy you may be looking across someone and feeling bad for them. Empathy means getting inside of them and understanding their reality and looking at their situation and saying "Not what would I do if I were in their position but what are they doing? Why are they doing what they are doing," from the perspective of what they have endured. And that is an additional step that a person has to take in order to be open to that... People will often say, "Why is it that those people do that thing? Why is it that those people are doing this over here?" And in my view, there is only one answer to that question: the only answer to that question is why do humans being do what they do when they are in that situation. It's not the people, those people. It's what do human beings do. And it calls for radical empathy to put ourselves inside the experiences of another and to allow ourselves the pain, allow ourselves the heartbreak, allow ourselves the sense of hopelessness, whatever it may be that they are experiencing. And it's a difficult thing to do, but it's necessary.

Even as Virginia got drunk, slept with too many men, and lost her house keys on a regular bases, Casey couldn't help but admire her friend, who didn't feel deterred by shame or failure. Virginia was not afraid of criticism-- that, Casey thought, was an extraordinary thing.

Ted: My dear Ella, Casey isn't the least bit interested in finance. I doubt she knows the difference between debt and equity.<br>
Ella: But... Ted, you didn't always know the difference, either. People have to learn things. And they have to be taught. Right?

"I don't want anything from you, Casey. I want to help." Ella tried to think of a new way to explain this to Casey, who obviously didn't trust anyone at all. Ted was like this. He always thought everyone had an ulterior motive-- that there could never be pure altruism.

From On being with Krista Tippett with Eula Biss<br>
I think there are some people who feel that nurturing their own fear will be a balm against danger. If you just feel fearful enough, and often enough, you'll save yourself from the dangers of the world. And I do think that there is this sense that if you're not trusting and suspicious enough and wary enough [then] you won't be hurt. And I don't think that's true. I think you get hurt either way. You get to live as a suspicious, wary, paranoid person who gets hurt or you get to live as someone who trusts other people and gets hurt.

From On being with Krista Tippett with Eula Biss<br>
Eula Biss: I have come to believe that we owe it to other people not to be afraid of them. And I've come to feel very strongly about that. I think fear is a deceptively destructive emotion and it's not just disabling in terms of the person who is fearful. You can be undone by your own fear. But the thing that goes unrecognized is that fear is very violent and that quite a bit of damage is done to people who are feared by the fearful.

From Molly's Game<br>
Judge: Based on all available information, this court manifestly disagrees with the government's sentencing recommendation. This courthouse is located within spitting distance of Wall Street. I know this from my personal experience trying to spit at it. The men and women who work there will commit more serious crimes by lunchtime today than the defendant has committed in this indictment. I simply don't see how either the people or the cause of justice are served by locking Molly Bloom in prison.<br>
Molly: It was as casual as if he was ordering lunch off a menu.<br>
Judge: Ms. Bloom, this court sentences you to two hundred hours of community service, one year of supervised probation, drug testing and a two hundred thousand dollar fine. This case is adjourned.<br>
Molly: And that was that. It was crying and hugging, jokes from my brothers. Tough talk about how no one messes with the Blooms and level-headed talk about Christmas miracles. Steaks and beer bought by my father and full reenactments. And in the middle of it all, as grateful as you are, the reality starts creeping toward you like the tide. And that's the first time you have the thought... "What do I do now?" ... I'm a felon. I'm 35 years old, unemployed, and pled guilty in a mob indictment... I owe the government close to two million dollars in taxes assessed on the civil forfeiture plus the two hundred thousand dollar fine. And you better believe they're gonna come get it... I have a quarter of a million dollars in legal bills. I don't know what I'd say in a job interview, or if I'll ever be given a job interview. I'll never be allowed to vote again... And for some reason, I'm not allowed to go to Canada. Did anything good come of this? Not really. But I learned something encouraging. I'm very hard to kill.<br>
Sport commentators: You and I both know people who have never gotten over it. I don't know if the young woman we've just seen is- is one of those people. We may not see her ski competitively again but I think we're gonna see her.<br>

Molly: Is that why they took it in the first place? So they could offer it back to me?<br>
Charlie: Yeah. For what it's worth, if we went to trial you'd have to hand over the forensic imaging in discovery.<br>
Molly: But that's different from voluntarily handing it over.<br>
Charlie: Sure, but it's not really voluntary anymore when the alternative is prison. And that's what they're gonna recommend, 42 months.<br>

Children will read their father's text messages saying he wished he'd never had kids. These guys-- These guys, where are they? Why are you in this alone? Where are your friends?

Where are the people you're protecting by not telling the whole story in the book, by settling the Brad Marion suit, by not taking five million dollars of your own money, by going to jail? Where did everybody go?!<br>

Charlie: Oh, that's great. Well, we don't have the luxury of integrity. You have to take the deal.<br>
Molly: No.<br>
Charlie: You stay out of jail, you get your money back, you pay your debts, you start a new life.<br>
Molly: No.<br>
Charlie: Is this self-imposed punishment for naming four guys in a book? It's not. You didn't do anything wrong.<br>
Molly: I threw four people under the bus for $35,000, Charlie. I noticed you kept that out of your speech to the prosecutor.<br>
Charlie: No, don't do that to me.<br>
Molly: I took advantage of gambling addicts. Donnie Silverman, my brilliant find, he lost -six million dollars on my table,<br>
Charlie: -Molly, stop, stop.<br>

For example, I can look at a flower and choose it has meaning or purpose to me or to others or to itself or to nature or I can choose that it has no meaning or some meaning. I can choose to believe or not.

From memory of Mulase's story during a MAT 21C lecture<br>
Memory of Mulase's memory: I was teaching a calculus course similar to this one and I had office hours. One day, I was in my office during my office hours. No one was in there so I was reading a mathematical paper. Then, a girl entered. She told me she was in my class and that she wanted to work with me. I told her to go away. But she didn't. She insisted that she really wants to work with me. So I sigh, stand up, walk over to my eight foot bookshelf, and take a one-inch book off of the shelf. I hand it to her. She leaves and I go back to reading my paper. A week later, she comes back and puts the book on my desk and says, "What's next?" I took the book, stood up, placed the book back on my bookshelf, sat back down, and began reading a mathematical paper. She persisted and said "So what's next?" I asked her, "State the problem that was presented in the book." She walks over to the chalkboard, looks down, chin to chest, and grabs her wrists while they are behind her back. Then she picks up the chalk and starts to write down the problem statement, word for word. I was surprised. Also, you need to know that every single page of that one inch book that I let her borrow was to solve one problem. In other words, it took a few hundred pages to solve a single problem. I looked at her and I said, "Now, solve the problem. Prove it." Again, she looked down, hands behind her back, picked up the chalk... and started writing, and explaining, and writing some more. After a few hours of writing and explaining, she solved the problem in front of me. I thought, "This girl is very special indeed." And so she joined my research team. She had a great memory. I could be talking about something that was five or six boards ago on the chalkboard and she would remember what I had written. We were trying to solve a problem that no one has ever been able to solve. And we were stuck. One day, she was looking through my research and she stopped, and pointed out a sign error. A minus sign was missing. I looked at it and I told her she was correct. When I added that minus sign, everything changed and we were able to solve a problem that no one has ever solved before. We published it and now she is a successful professor.

While many mathematics professors want to have a large stature, feel powerful, and try to prove themselves, Mulase says, "I want to be a child, with a telescope or magnifying glass so I can still enjoy the world."

Me: What's your favorite award?<br>
Mulase: I'm not that kind of person who gets famous awards. But I value the distinguished teaching award from UCD because I was brought up in a different language and culture, and I immigrated here, and receiving positive remarks for my teaching is quite an achievement to me. Probably I'm not a good teacher in a sense that I teach them the material. I try to be like Professor Mikio Sata was to me: to give them inspiration. If I am successful, they study themselves. To me, an ideal teacher does not give the material. Rather, make the students decide to work themselves. Sometimes I am successful. In that sense, I am happy.

	<p id="392">
From an essay<br>
Upon arrival at the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton, Mulase possessed an idea of a solution to a long-standing problem. He gave a very successful talk and thought the problem would be finished in a couple of weeks. However, one person did not believe him at all during his talk. Everybody was enjoying the talk and feeling happy but this one individual was extremely unhappy. As soon as Mulase's talk was finished, everybody left and the one unhappy man shut the door, ran to Mulase, and said, "I didn't believe anything you said." He was Professor Pierre Deligne from Belgium and arguably, the greatest math professor in Princeton to this very day. Professor Deligne drew a picture of a cat with all of its fur standing up and told Mulase he felt unhappy like the cat. Mulase tried to change his definition to accommodate Deligne, but Deligne responded, "If you define it this way, your theorem here would be wrong." So Mulase said, "Ok, maybe I'll define it this way." Again, Deligne responded, "Then that part of the theorem doesn't work." The two discussed the problem for a couple of hours and Deligne rejected all of Mulase's proposals. This is when Mulase realized that Deligne must have thought about the problem entirely. Hence, Mulase trashed his entire construction and started from scratch because what he built would not work.<br>
Everyday, for three months, Mulase meets with Deligne and proposes more ideas. Deligne shot every one of them down. After three months of no progress, Mulase thought, "Why did I come here? Did I destroy my career here? Should I jump from the building? Is that my future?" He was then invited to give a talk at Brown and Yale. While waiting at the Princeton junction for the train, Mulase explains, "Suddenly, it became pitch dark. I asked myself: what happened? It was dark and then a few moments later, the beam came down from heaven to me. I looked up--the entire theory was there. I saw it. Suddenly, the darkness was over and there was nobody. What happened? Everybody was already in the train." During the five hours on the Amtrak, he wrote down everything. He had the result but had to stay in Brown and Yale for a couple of weeks. The trip was a blur because he wanted to go back to Princeton.<br>
As soon as he returned, he rushed to Deligne and said, "I think I have the answer." Mulase started to write one line on the chalkboard and suddenly, for the first time, Deligne smiled and concurred, "Yes, you got it." Surprised by his quick response, Mulase asked, "You knew the answer? Why didn't you tell me?" Deligne responded, "No, I didn't know. You discovered it. But as soon as you told me what was correct, I was able to tell you that that is the right answer. But I didn't know it." Then Mulase recounts he got sick from his long hours of hard work.<br>

From an essay<br>
Mulase describes the research appointment and the Institude of Advanced Studies at Princeton as an "intellectual heaven where people are thinking, talking, and producing a new science. It's the spirit of academics." According to Mulase, one can swim in a regular swimming pool. However, swimming in a current and following a current makes one swim faster. Conducting research there is like swimming with a current behind you. He felt he was "invited to be in a castle, with a king and court but not in a bad political sense, but a genuine sense like Plato's academia."

Mulase: At UCLA, I had to teach. I taught. I came home. I started to do research. Then later, my wife came out saying, "Good night." I said good night. A while later my wife said, "Good morning." I said good morning. Then a while later she said, "Good night." And then later she said, "Today is your teaching day." Whoops! Then I looked at the calendar and the days jumped. When you are excited, the short arm of the clock can jump. Have you seen the movie Inception?<br>
Me: Yes.<br>
Mulase: This time I am not really dreaming, more like daydreaming. In Inception, when you start to dream, time stretches twenty times. When you dream inside a dream, it is four hundred times. That was happening. In a couple of days, I was able to figure out something people doesn't do. In three months, I was able to do something people couldn't do in a hundred years. That's exactly four hundred times faster. I wrote the paper and it was published in a top journal in the world.<br>

So Mulase stayed up all night, wrote every single word he would say in class for each lecture because he "did not speak English very well and [he] did not want to be bad." However, after writing everything, he memorized all of it and presented the material without any notes and students liked it.

During the first four months of marriage, Mulase's wife used to tell people how she was sometimes frightened for Mulase. She served him dinner and while eating with his knife and fork, he would suddenly stop in mid-air. His wife did not know what to do but she did not disturb him: she knew he was thinking. Other times, Mulase's wife awakens from sleep and realizes Mulase is not asleep. Mulase explains: "This continued for about one hundred days. Sleeping and not sleeping become the same. It's a daydream. But I remember I was like a bird. Flying high, and then flying in the complete mist. You don't see anything. Suddenly all the mist clears. You fly high and see the entire landscape. And you go on and on and on. Then a hundred days later, I started to write everything I saw. It took six months to finish. I had a huge stack of scratch paper and inside was a solution to the problem."

During the talk, Mikio Sato shared his emotional experience of being trashed from the mathematical society and in his isolation, discovering a solution to a problem people failed to solve for centuries. His ascent from being a "nobody" to being a highly respectable mathematician signaled Mulase to want to study with Mikio Sato. Sato did not teach specific mathematics but rather taught Mulase how to think about mathematics. For example, Sata taught Mulase what it means to do mathematics. Namely, Mulase explains, "When you do mathematics, you want to listen to the nature. What does it tell you? How does it sound? You have to get that instead of imposing that nature should behave like this or the theorem should look like this. Just listen."

From an essay<br>
Being a top runner at the University of Tokyo meant Mulase attained the highest grades. Thus, highly respectable. However, his girlfriend rejected him and shattered his heart. Suddenly, nothing mattered to him. He disappaered for one year; he did not go to class; he stayed in his apartment. Since he did not desire to meet people, he read and studied mathematics on his own. When he returned a year later, people thought he dropped out of college-- he was frowned upon; classmates called him the "failed brother." Mulase [went] from being a top-runner-highly respected studient to failing exams, since he did not take them, and where classmates were condescending. More importantly, he realized he could do whatever he wanted because he "did not care what people said or how they viewed [him]." Hence, Mulase knew he learned a lot of mathematics not covered in the curriculum during that one year and he finally realized that the "curriculum does not matter."

From an essay<br>
During his freshmen year [at the University of Tokyo], Mulase took a law course taught by Shigemitsu Dando, who would later become a supreme court judge. Mulase thought to himself, "What made Dando devote his entire life to the legal system?" Although Mulase enjoyed the course, he did not want to devote his life to law... As a kid, Mulase enjoyed manipulation: collecting rocks and melting them. He wanted to resemble that kind of work in physics, chemistry, or biology but realized how these studies would become gigantic. If he worked on a specific task in chemistry, Mulase felt he would "become part of the system" and would lose the big picture. He explains how a chemist needs labs, machines, test tubes, and equipment, but the chemist will not know everything. In most cases, scientific papers are co-authored by five or more people, according to Mulase. Hence, the "chemist can not be a master of everything." After eliminating these science fields, he discovers that "mathematics would not fail [him] because [he] could master what [he] wanted to do and master the theory."

From an essay<br>
Motohico Mulase recalls spending his youthful days conducting science experiments: going into drug stores, buying nitric or sulfuric acid, pouring them into anything, and observing the effects. After obtaining a telescope from his father, Mulase collected and observed minerals and rocks under a microscope. He recalls placing a grain of sand under a microscope and seeing a "beautiful gem" under magnification. In the sixth grade, his father and he built a telescope from a kit. On one night, Mulase went on his roof, directed his telescope where no stars existed-- just darkness. He waited for an hour and suddenly, through the microscope, saw countless stars because his eyes adjusted to the darkness. He felt like he was "in the middle of the universe." Besides his curiosity in the physical world, he relished reading novels, textbooks, and other books. In school, he would finish a textbook in a couple of days upon receiving the book.

From 21 Grams written by Guillermo Alliarga<br>
There is a number hidden in every act of life, in every aspect of the universe. Fractals, matter-- that there's a number screaming to tell us something. I guess I try to tell them that numbers are a door to understanding a mystery that's bigger than us. How two people, strangers, come to meet. There's a poem by a Venezuelan writer that begins-- "The earth turned to bring us closer. It turned on itself and in us... until it finally brought us together in this dream." There's so many things that have to happen for two people to meet and-- anyway, that's-- that's what mathematics are.

From Neil Gaiman and David Mitchell<br>
Gaiman: One of the things I love about David is sort of leaping out of the boxes or staying in the boxes and grabbing other boxes and pulling them back into the box, which I think is wonderful.... Genre is fundamentally irrelevant because it's going to guide you away from things that you would like but you didn't know it. Genre lies to you.
Mitchell: Surely, all that matters is: is this damn book any good or not? Who cares if it has a dragon in it... we shouldn't even be talking about it in the first place, I feel. For me it's a beautiful playground, it's a set of colors that are in our paintbox. Why confide one novel to one genre? They are maybe representative of the ways we experience the world. There are times when we see it as pastiche, satire, like a Carion film. There are times when we experience it as something more tragic; there are times when we flip over our laptops and speak to people in Japan in real time and I can see the beads of sweat on my friend's face. So there are times when life feels science-fictiony. Sometimes, usually Tuesdays, I have a hard-boiled detective kind of days...; there are times when especially during the first six months of being in love where all these weird chemicals and drugs are going around your body and life feels like this mad misty love effused romantic comedy and it's just beautiful and you're drunk on it. Genre is a gift to artists to reproduce those states. Why chop off your own limbs... by saying I won't put any fantasy in my novel.<br>
Gaiman: Real life is awful in staying in genre boundaries.

Oracle: You know where. And if you can't find the answer, then I'm afraid there may be no tomorow for any of us.<br>
Neo: What does that mean?<br>
Oracle: Everything that has a beginning has an end. I see the end coming. I see the darkness spreading. I see death. And you are all that stands in his way.<br>
Neo: Smith.<br>
Oracle: *nods* Very soon he's going to have the power to destroy this world, but I believe he won't stop there; he can't. He won't stop until there's nothing left at all.<br>
Neo: What is he?<br>
Oracle: He is you. Your opposite, your negative, the result of the equation trying to balance itself out.<br>
Neo: What if I can't stop him?<br>
Oracle: One way or another, Neo, this war is going to end. Tonight, the future of both worlds will be in your hands… or in his.

Merovingian: *laughs* Come, now. What kind of question is this? Of course I know. It's my business to know. Some might think this a strange coincidence, but I do not. I am curious, though, as to how it actually happened. Do you know?<br>
Trinity: No.<br>
Merovingian: No? I didn't think so. But it is always best to ask.<br>
Morpheus: We want to make a deal.<br>
Merovingian: *laughs* Always straight to business, huh, Morpheus? Okay. I have something you want. To make a deal, you must have something I want, yes? And it so happens there is something I want. Something I've wanted ever since I first came here. It is said they cannot be taken, they can only be given.<br>
Morpheus: What?<br>
Merovingian: The eyes of the Oracle. *laughs*<br>
Merovingian: I have told you before, there's no escaping the nature of the universe. It is that nature that has again brought you to me. Where some see coincidence, I see consequence. Where others see chance, I see cost. Bring me the eyes of the Oracle, and I will give you back your saviour. That seems a particularly fair and reasonable deal to me. Yes, no?<br>

Rama-Kandra: I cannot say. Who knows such things? Only the Oracle.<br>
Neo: You know the Oracle?<br>
Rama-Kandra: Everyone knows the Oracle. I consulted with her before I met with the Frenchman. She promised she would look after Sati after we said goodbye.<br>
Neo: Goodbye? You're not staying with her?<br>
Rama-Kandra: It is not possible. Our arrangement with the Frenchman was for our daughter only. My wife and I must return to our world.<br>
Neo: Why?<br>
Rama-Kandra: That is our karma.<br>
Neo: You believe in karma?<br>
Rama-Kandra: Karma's a word. Like ‘love.' A way of saying ‘what I am here to do.' I do not resent my karma – I'm grateful for it. Grateful for my wonderful wife, for my beautiful daughter. They are gifts. And so I do what I must do to honour them.<br>

Rama-Kandra: No. I don't mind. The answer is simple. I love my daughter very much. I find her to be the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. But where we are from, that is not enough. Every program that is created must have a purpose; if it does not, it is deleted. I went to the Frenchman to save my daughter. You do not understand.<br>
Neo: I just have never…<br>

Neo: It's a… human emotion.<br>
Rama-Kandra: No, it is a word. What matters is the connection the word implies. I see that you are in love. Can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection?<br>
Neo: Anything.<br>
Rama-Kandra: Then perhaps the reason you're here is not so different from the reason I'm here.

Oracle: I'm the Oracle. I wish there was an easier way to get through this but there ain't. I'm sorry this had to happen. I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here like you remember me. But it wasn't meant to be.<br>
Trinity: What happened?<br>
Oracle: I made a choice, and that choice cost me more than I wanted it to.<br>
Morpheus: What choice?<br>
Oracle: To help you to guide Neo. Now, since the real test for any choice is having to make the same choice again, knowing full well what it might cost – I guess I feel pretty good about that choice, 'cause here I am, at it again.<br>
Trinity: Do you know what happened to Neo?<br>
Oracle: Yes. He's trapped in a place between this world and the machine world. The link is controlled by a program called the Trainman. He uses it to smuggle programs in and out of the Matrix. If he finds out where Neo is before you get to him, then I'm afraid our choices are going to become difficult.<br>

From David Mitchell<br>
Creation myths aren't real. And if they sound too neat then they are partly manufactured. No one knows what the imagination is. And the words inspiration and creativity are handy but what on earth are they? Inspiration is just having an idea. Creativity is an inclination towards making something. So instead, I'll give you three factors which fed into why I'm here as a writer. These are: my speech impediment, which made it very hard to express myself externally, verbally. Yet, I'm a word nerd, so what was the only answer that was not politically dangerous for a thirteen-year-old kid at a state school. While the outlet was writing, there I can feed my word nerdery. That's number one. Two-just the gratification I got back when it's profoundly fulfilling to write a sentence where there's nothing wrong with it. It's just well-crafted, and you know, English subject-verb-object. Let's see if we can make the object passive. Put that in front, and then, put in the phrase. Have a cliche here, but then just *BOOM* explode the cliche from inside and end with a comma and an adverb, FULL STOP. OH! Look at that! It's just, it's got a rightness about it. That's really fulfulling. That's one of the best feelings ever. Get a few of those and you've got a nearly perfect paragraph. It's never perfect, perfect, but it's nearly perfect. And it's good enough. So, just the gratification, that's why I'm here. And the third is genetics. I was built this way. I don't know why- thanks Mom, thanks Dad, thanks universe! Thanks tea, thanks stone. Good night.
	</p>

	<p id="346">
From David Mitchell<br>
There's a lot of that in novels. You have to search for the right wrongness because the right rightness doesn't work. If the novel was a company then its mission statement would need to be, "This has to work as a novel!" and sometimes authenticity will impede that mission statement. And sometimes, inauthenticity will enhance it. It's actually like writing a novel about a life. If you do it accurately, in real time, you'll need to include the long turgid monotony sections where not much happens. The same for war. You need to edit it so that it has a coherent form. If you don't, then you get a dead novel. No one buys it. I can't feed my children. It's disastrous! I wouldn't be here!
	</p>

	<p id="345">
From David Mitchell<br>
We are word nerds. I love the difference between the words "maybe" and "perhaps." They mean the same thing but when I'm writing I think about when to use maybe and when to use perhaps. I love this stuff! Like, some people love baseball cards or different types of boats or stamp collecting. For me, for all writers, it's words and their textures and their nuances and the way they do fit together or don't, concordingly, or discordingly, I love all that stuff! Yeah, I'm a word nerd, always have been.
	</p>

	<p id="344">
From David Mitchell<br>
I have not really noticed it. It's just, I just get unhappy if I don't spend time transferring what I imagine into text and when I'm transferring it into text this sets up a feedback loop. The process of transferring it into text creates demand for more imaginary things to transfer so this virtuous spiral gets set up
	</p>

	<p id="343">
From David Mitchell<br>
We all have imaginations. It's a human function. It allows us to experiment with our environment without having any physical consequences of that. It's a Darwinian trick that we've evolved but animals have them as well, I believe. The way it gets used, of course, we all have faces. We all have retinas, but they're somewhat different... All kids invent things. All kids have invisible friends. All kids are scared of what's in the darkness. I suppose it's not that we writers evolve in a different direction. I think writers don't properly grow up. Writers continue to have invisible friends. It's just they become more complex and turn into Madame Bovary rather than Casper the Friendly Ghost or Frank the monster who lives under your bed.

From David Mitchell<br>
The biggest question I think about is, "how can I make this damn book work?" and anything larger than the rectangle of my iMac screen is not my business. It's not good for me to think about where I sit in the pantheon. It's not good to Google myself. It's not good for me to think,  "am I inventing something new here?" It's only good for me to think, "What do I want to write? What excites me?" and "What gives you that literary adrenaline whoosh?" and once I've decided that, "How can I make it work?" So, that's the biggest question I ever considered.
	</p>

	<p id="341">
From David Mitchell<br>
Stories have a number of beginnings. And often, if a writer gives you a perfect, flawless creation myth for a novel generally it's an anecdote. It's been polished, and polished, and polished. Actually, they evolve from several stem cells, not just one, I think.

From David Mitchell<br>
I was young. I might not do it these days. When you're young, you don't have yet the technique but you do have a certain "Yeah! I'll have a go at that!" You have a certain rashness or unguardedness and I think that's why I didn't think about the dangers. I didn't think I was being a daredevil doing anything particularly dangerous. Looking back, I probably was. Had that book flopped it would've been difficult to get another contract from another publisher, but luckily, it sold one and a half million and counting. But I don't deserve the credit for having seen anything blindingly original and then went ahead and wrote it. I simply wondered what it would look like if someone did write it and no one else was doing it, so I did it. Sometimes your youth and your inexperience can be an ally and it was in that case for me.

Question: What made Cloud Atlas such a popular book?<br>
Mitchell: I just wrote the book(Cloud Atlas) I wanted to write and that's what it looked like. And in a way, I shouldn't think about it too much because if I did, I might be tempted to try to repeat myself and that is not good for a writer. So I don't know and in a way, I don't wish to know too accurately what it was that made that book work the way it did work... It's important to put some space between each of the books so that you're not going over the same old ground. Writers who have done that, the books get a little more disappointing each time and I don't want to be one of those writers. One of the ways to avoid that fate is to be omnivorous.Omnivorous in how I live, what I read, but also omnivorous in how I write, and if my books are my children I want them to have distinct personalities and not have any twins in the family... ...    ... ... ...

From Krista Tippett's conversation with Resmaa Menakem<br>
Krista: One thing that occured to me reading your work is: one reason that elders are so comforting and healing, and children understand that, is cause not everyone becomes an elder, some people just get old.<br>
Resmaa: That's right.<br>
Krista: But if you get older and wiser, even if a little bit, you settle into your body. You're just more integrated... There's a line from you: all adults need to learn how to soothe and anchor themselves, rather than expect others or demand others to soothe them. All adults need to heal and grow up. So many of the things we've done in this culture, especially around the invention of whiteness, allows people to avoid developing the full range of being a grown up.

From Buddha by Osamu Tezuka<br>
Buddha: Prince Crystal, how is it that a doctor is able to heal people? If the patient merely writhes about crying in pain, the doctor cannot learn the cause. The doctor must talk with the patient, and then examine him, to discover the cause. I'm a doctor who heals the sickness in people's souls, so to speak. I listened to your complaints. You believe that your suffering is ome kind of fate that you shouldered upon birth. You're mistaken. You do not suffer because your mother was a slave woman, you suffer because you shunned your mother and let her die miserably, and you regret it. Hold a proper memorial service in her honor and your pain will vanish. You regret that you've massacred the Shakyan people. Ending this other pain of yours will require great resolve. Forgive the Shakya and return to Kosala with your army. Then the pain will end. Then you will not have to kill. Your mind will be cured. If you refuse to implement, prince, you'll suffer for the rest of your life. Changing your mother's caste won't change a thing for you. Prince, you seem obsessed with appearances, losing face and such trifles. Whether it is born on trash or on flowers, an elephant is an elephant. The same is true for humans. You say your mother was a slave, but whatever her birth or caste, she was your mother. Where is the shame in that?<br>
...<br>
Rahula: Mother! When I became a slave, I understood something. A man needs no caste! That's why I accept this labor.<br>

From Buddha by Osamu Tezuka<br>
Buddha: Brahman, give me strength! That cloud. Look at that cloud in the sky. Look long enough and you'll see how its shape changes, gradually. A cloud never stays the same shape for very long. Moreover, it sometimes brings rain, even thunder. So too with human fate, like a cloud, a man's fortunes are ever shifting. Now he lives like a king, but tomorow he's just a beggar. A person's life changes, like a cloud. No life is uniformly happy or unhappy over its course. And a cloud doesn't change shape on its own. The winds, the heat, the sun, night and day force the change! Likewisse with our fates: they have causes... there is no fate that does not have a cause. Twenty years ago, I, too had my course altered, when a wise man showed me sickness, death, human misery. I was shaken, and that was the cause of my forsaking the castle. It set me on a path of trials. If a tree sprouting where there is ample sun and water, is nonetheless choked under the earth by stones or is rotting at the roots, it will not grow strong. Since the cause is not visible, before anyone will ever notice, it will shrivel and die. The people of Kapilavastu once enjoyed riches and leisure, and only interrupted the pouring of wine and the dancing o engage in factional strife. Shakyan society was rotten to the core. I knew that growing up in such a place I would make no decent king. I'd just become a wreck, and die. So I forsook my family, even my son Rahula, and left. Precisely in these harsh times, you must think and do rightly! Do not despair. If you do not swerve, even as you suffer, it will bring forth good results in the future. Do not worry. The end of one life is the beginning of the next. If you fight, many more of you will die. How is that different from Kosalan cruelty? Didn't I just tell you about causes and effects? There sits a [prince] who suffers more terribly than any of you people, tormented that he has killed hundred, including his own mother! He will always regret it. That, more than any torture, wound, or illness, is insufferable! ... My son, Rahula, if you really want to undergo trials, why not stay here in your country.<br>
Buddha's wife: The Kosalans know that Rahula is royalty. So they treat him horrily, giving him tough chores.<br>
Buddha: That's your trial! Don't you see? Persevere!!

Buddha: Even if the soldiers are too late, you can find peace, if you seek it.<br>
Ahimsa: Am I gonna die? Does dying hurt a lot?<br>
Buddha: It depends on your own state of mind. You say you've killed hundreds of people. Did you ever find it in your heart to spare anyone at all? By sparing one life, you have done great good in this world because that baby will grow up to become a man and have children on his own. Centuries later, he will have a million descendants, who will say centuries ago a man saved our lives, and that is why we prosper today... Killing a hundred is not good. But sparing one for life leads to a sacred million... Be reborn and come to me.

[The demon tries to kill Buddha but Lata, one of Buddha's disciples, sacrifices her life to save the Buddha]. Ananda, Buddha's other disciple, washed Lata's body... and placed her on a wooden bier adorned with wild grasses and flowers. It was all he could do, this token of love.<br>
Buddha: As long as I live, I'll remember Lata, who protected me from the snake[demon-possessed]. She sacrificed her life to save mine. For her sake, I must be about often, to deliver sermons. We will be doing her part too as we try to save people.<br>
Ananda: Where do you think Lata went when she died?<br>
Buddha: I believe she is now one with nature's essence. Dissolved into tiny bits invisible to our eyes, she scattered into the great sky. Someday we shall go, too... and there meet and intermingle with Lata again.<br>
Buddha's inner god: As you gladly enjoy your cozy life in this bamboo grove, people are struggling, suffering, and dying in misery, in ever greater numbers. "Awakened one," it is for you to save those people. Do not waste another moment.

If not, they are cut down. What does a tree feel when it's being axed? "It hurts"? "They're killing me"? "Poor me"? Tree... if you had a mouth, you'd scream. If you had eyes, you'd weep. If you could move, you'd try to run away. But a tree can do none of those things, so it calmly awaits the day. If your fate is inescapable, then be brave and be prepared. Live rightly, act rightly until that day.

From Stealing Time by David Grann<br>
[Rickey] Henderson told me, "I'm happy to see one of the guys get out of the league, to get a chance to move on[to the major league]." He seemed genuinely glad for him and refused to mention his own circumstances. On another night on the field, however, he pointed to the Surf Dawg logo on his jersey and said, "I never thought I might end my career in this uniform." I asked if he would retire at the end of the season. "I don't know if I can keep going," he said. "I'm tired, you know." As he picked up his glove, he stared at the field for a moment. Then he said, "I just don't know if Rickey can stop."
	</p>

	<p id="310">
From Stealing Time by David Grann<br>
That month, [Henderson's] batting average had plunged from .311 to .247-- one of the lowest on the team. In May, he hit only one home run; he had none in June. "He still sees the ball well, but he doesn't have the bat speed to get around," said Kennedy.<br>
Kennedy: i understand if you're through.<br>
Henderson: No, man, it's not that. It's just my damn hitting. I can't get it straight.<br>
...<br>
Trying to improve his average, [Henderson] started to experiment with his trade-mark crouch; he stood straighter at the plate, until he was an almost unrecognizable figure. "I remember at the end of my career I began to doubt my ability," Kennedy said. "I knew what I wanted to do, but my body wouldn't let me do it. And I called my father and said, 'Dad, did you ever start to think you weren't good enough to play this game?' And he said, 'I did, and once you do you can never get it back.'"<br>
	</p>

From Stealing Time by David Grann<br>
Even though Henderson played well, with two singles and a walk, the Surf Dawgs lost, 5-0. His wife, who had come to see him play that weekend with two of their daughters, told the team's general manager, "Why won't he just quit and come home?" As he left the field, fireworks began to explode in the sky above him, the finale of Rickey Henderson Night...<br>
...<br>
"The most important thing to being a good base stealer is you got to be fearless," he said. "You know they're all coming for you; everyone in the stadium knows they're coming for you. And you got to say to yourself, 'I don't give a dang. I'm gone.'"... "To steal a base, you need to think you're invincible."

...<br>
The manager, Terry Kennedy, who had played fourteen years in the major leagues as a catcher, and whose father had played in the majors as well, told me, "I sometimes call this the Discovery League. Everybody here is trying to discover something about themselves-- whether they should continue pursuing their dream or whether it's time to finally let it go."<br>
...<br>
Kennedy told me that he had initially worried how Henderson would fit in with the team, especially considering his perks. "I wasa never into guys who chirp," he said. But, to his surprise, Henderson had gone out of his way to mentor other players. "I don't want to go too keep into his head," Kennedy said. "But something's clearly going on in there. I think maybe he's trying to show clubs that he's willing to be a different player."

From Stealing Time by David Grann<br>
In 1989, the [Oakland] A's signed [Henderson] to a four-year contract worth twelve million dollars, which made him the highest-paid player in the game; but less than two years later, after several players surpassed that sum, he demanded a new contract. The pitcher Goose Gossage, who played with Hunderson on the A's once said, "Henderson set a new standard for selfishness." ... in the view of many players and sportswriters, he was also "greedy," "egomaniacal,"... "the classic baseball mercenary," and "the King of I." In other words, he was the last player anyone thought would join the Golden Baseball League...<br>
He knew that his reputation had probably hurt his chances of being brought onto a team as an elder statesman and bench player. "There's always that concern: will Rockey be willing to come off the bench?" Henderson said. "I would. If you let me retire in a major-league uniform, you won't hear a peep out of me."

Extending his arms, he said, "Look at me. I ain't got no injuries. I got no problem with my eyes. My knees are good. The only problem I have is a little pain in my hip, and it ain't nothin' a little ice can't cure... I ain't giving up hope. I know if people would just come out to see me play they would realize that Rickey is still Rickey... People always ask me why I still want to play, but I want to know why no one will give me an opportunity... I'll tell you the truth. I'd give everything up-- every record, the Hall of Fame, all of it-- for just one more chance."

He took a sip of his whiskey. "I can already hear the critics saying, 'The great squid hunter lost his blasted squid again.' Do you know how it feels when everything goes to custard like this?" He fell silent again, then added, "I'm not going to stop. I'm not going to give up. I don't care if someone finds the squid first. I'll still go until I find it myself."

"I'm not antisocial," he said. "I just don't socialize." His sister told me, "We'd love him even if he chased mushrooms, but we just wish he's spend the same emotion on people as he did on squid."

[Shea, a surviving fireman from 9/11,] seemed aware that, after months of searching, he might never know everything-- that there was no way to piece together a logical story for that day.

Memory is a code to who we are, a collection not simply of dates and facts but also of emotional struggles, epiphanies, and transformations. And in the wake of tragedy it is vital to recovery. After a traumatic event, people tend to store a series of memories and arrange them into a meaningful narrative. They remember exactly where they were and to whom they were talking. But what does one do when the narrative is shattered, when some-- or most-- of the pieces of the puzzle are missing?

Reporting, like detective work, is a process of elimination. It requires that you gather and probe innumerable versions of a story until, to brrow a phrase from Sherlock Holmes, "the one which remains must the truth."<br>
...<br>
The protagonists are mortal: as with Dr. Watson, they can observe, but they don't necessarily see. Pieces of the puzzle often remain elusive.<br>
...<br>
Part of [Sherlock] Holmes's appeal is that he restores order to a bewildering universe. But it is the messiness of life, and the human struggle to make sense of it, that drew me to the subjects in this collection. As Holmes once conceded to Dr. Watson, "If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make all the fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable."<br>
...<br>
Yet in the end these stories seemed to provide at least glimpses of the human condition, and why some people devote themselves to good and others to evil. As Holmes put it, "Life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent."

Pope John Paull II (Letter to the artists): On the threshold of the third millennium, my hope for all of you who are artists is that you will have an especially intense experience of creative inspirationn. May the beauty which you pass on to generations still to come be such that it will stir them to wonder! Faced with the sacredness of life and of the human person, and before the marvels of the universe, wonder is the only appropriate attitude.<br>
Narrator: From this wonder there can come that enthusiasm of which Norwid spoke in his poem. People of today and tomorrow need this enthusiasm if they are to meet and master the crucial challenges which stand before us. Thanks to this enthusiasm, humanity, every time it loses its way, will be able to lift itself up and set out again on the right path.

From Cloud Atlas philosophy from Like Stories of Old<br>
Narrator: Art, in all its many forms, can help you discover what beauty is. The characters in Cloud Atlas all find meaning and motivation in the beauty transferred to them from those who came before. It allows each of the characters to elevate their individual and highly particular struggles to something that comes closer to carrying universal meaning. This is when we realize that the boundary between our heart and the rest of the world is just a convention, waiting to be transcended. If we can conceive of doing so, then even the tiniest victory becomes ones of cosmic significance.

Solzhenitsyn: If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either-- but right through every human heart. During the life of any heart this line keeps changing place; sometimes it is squeezed one way by exuberant evil and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space for good to flourish. One and the same human being is, at various ages, under various circumstances, a totally different human being. At times he close to being a devil, at times to sainthood. But his name doesn't change, and to that name we ascribe the whole lot, good and evil.

It's those ideas that sometimes catch you and they are very important to you. And when you catch one, it's such a thrill that you instantly fall in love and you know what you're going to do. There are ideas for everything. It's just catching them is the thing. I always equate it to fishing: you have to have patience. I say a desire is like a bait on the hook. You desire an idea. It's like bait on the hook and if you have patience, those ideas will start swimming in.

Q: I guess people think beauty, filth, they don't go hand in hand. Depravity, corruption.<br>
David: I always say that if you don't know what it is, a sore, a deep cut with pus and discoloration, can be very beautiful. But as soon as you name it, it stops being beautiful to most people. A sore can be a great beauty of organic phenomenon.

[Consciousness made its impact on my work right from the beginning.] I think I had so many anxieties and fears and I felt those lifting. Bliss is a thing in this field, the Unified field. Bliss, they say, is the sweetest nectar of life. Bliss is physical, emotional, mental, spiritual happiness, and you can vibrate with this bliss. And it's this happiness from within. True happiness isn't out there. True happiness lies within. And I always wondered, "Where is this within?" And they don't say where it is. And then they don't even say how to get to it. This is the beauty of this technique. There are lots of forms of meditation but with transcendental meditation, to me, the key is the word transcend, to dive all the way in. It's a huge realm between the surface of life and this fundamental pure consciousness. But it's there and when you're in it, you know you're in it. It's familiar but it's you. And right away a happiness, but it's not like a goofball happiness. It's a thick beauty. It's a thick beauty to appreciate life and living. And why suffer? Suffering starts to go and people say, "We gotta have anger, you gotta have an edge to create." You gotta know about anger, you gotta have energy, you gotta have clarity to create. You gotta be able to catch ideas, you gotta be able to be strong enough to fight unbelievable pressure and stress and the whole thing in this world. That will lift because this whole thing is tied to world peace, but it's gonna be a better world. But it's still a very tough world and this just gives you more and more ability to say it just looks beautiful. It's way way way better. And this happened right away.

From David Lynch<br>
If you have a golf ball size consciousness, when you read a book, you will have a golf ball size understanding... when you look out, a golf ball size awareness... and when you wake up in the morning, a golf ball size wafefullness. But if you could expand that consciousness, then you read the book, more understanding; you look out, more awareness; and when you wake up, more wakefullness. It's consciousness, and there's an ocean of pure vibrant consciousness inside each one of us and it's right at the source and base of mind, right at the source of thought, and it's also at the source of all matter. And Maharishi Mahesh Yogi teaches a technique called transcendental meditation. It's a simple easy effortless technique, yet supremely profound that allows any human being to dive within, experiencing subtler levels of mind and intellect and transcend and experience this ocean of pure consciousness. This pure consciousness is called by modern physics the unified field. It's at the base of all mind and all matter. And now modern science says, all of matter, everything that is a thing emerges from this field. And this field has qualities like bliss, intelligence, creativity, universal love, energy, peace. And it's not the intellectual understanding of this field, but the experiencing of it that does everything. You dive within and transcending, experiencing this field of pure consciousness and you enliven it, you unfold it, it grows, and the final outcome of this growth of consciousness is called enlightenment. And enlightenment is the full potential of all of us human beings. And a side effect of enlivening this consciousness is negativity starts to recede. When I started meditating, I was filled with anxieties, filled with fears, kind of a depression, and anger. And I took this anger out on my first wife and after two weeks of meditation, she comes to me and she says, "What's going on?" And I was quiet for a moment because it could have been any number of things she might have been referring to. But I finally said, "What do you mean?" And she said, "This anger, where did it go?" And I didn't even realize it had lifted. Now these negative things like anger and depression and sorrow-- they're beautiful things in a story but they're like a poison to the filmmaker, they're a poison to the painter, they're poison to creativity, they're like a vice-grip. If you're super depressed you can hardly get outta bed, let alone, think ideas and have that creativity flowing. So it's money in the bank to get that beautiful consciousness growing, which is flowing creativity-- the ability to catch ideas at a deeper level, intuition grows. This field is a field of pure knowingness. You dive in there, you sort of just know how to go. You know how to solve solutions. It's like an ocean of solutions. And you can just feel this thing growing but the ultimate thing for me is the enjoyment of the doing, the enjoyment of life grows huge. I love making films now more than ever before. Ideas flow more. Everybody has more fun on the set. Creativity flows. People look like friends and not like enemies. It's a beautiful beautiful thing and it's us. In vedic science, this field of pure consciousness is called atman, the self, the self of us all. At that level of life, we are all one. We're one. Diversity up here. Unity down below. It's a great thing for the filmmaker.

From David Grann<br>
But learning to love to read, I think, is the most important thing because it gives you a skill you can take anywhere.<br>
Read what you like. I don't think it matters so much. If a child loves graphic novels or comic books, whatever it is that is turning them on to read and turning on their imagination.<br>
But then I think it is very important as they get older to read subject matter that will open their eyes to realms and people. Sometimes people are going through things they understand, and sometimes people are going through things they really can't fathom because they are growing up halfway around the world in a war-torn area or battling racism. So, I think both fiction and non-fiction are really important. They teach you the power to begin to perceive the world through the lives of others.

Mayan Ainsworth, Curator: You're never allowed to stop and stay too long in one place.<br>
Keith Christiansen, Chairman of European Paintings: We find this scene of monks who have stripped down, bathing in the pool. Here, kids are playing a game of cock throw. All of this is shown not with any sense of mockery, but with a real participation and the sense of the continuum of life...[Pieter] celebrates the landscape and celebrates those who work the fields. I think it is a very strong reminder of when man and nature were much closer than they are today. Isn't this the way we all like to imagine the farmers? That those that are cloest to nature are experiencing the truest life? A masterpiece in painting is very much like a great novel. It takes you to a place where you haven't been. It gives you insight into various aspects of life. John Brealey, who was our paintings conservator, used to have a term for masterpiece. He called it "a life-changer." You look at thtis painting and from this point on anytime you look at a field of wheat, this is the picture that is going to become the lens through which you see landscape. It is a life-changer: it changes the way you see life.

From Roy Hargrove<br>
If you are already starting to try to be a musician or artist or something like that because you want to make money because you want to do a job, that's the wrong way. You have to do this because you love it. And it doesn't matter if you broke, you're still gonna do it. I mean, I go out to jam sessions and I play regardless of whether I'm getting a check or not. It's about... you have to love this thing man. You have to love it. And breathe it. It's your morning coffee. It's your food. That's why you become an artist. Art is a miracle of society. People look to art to help them forget about their problems and their troubles and things like that. In order to be a mirror like that... it's not about a job so much. I mean, I just don't think about it like that. I never did... Larry Willis, a great pianist once told me once, "If you take care of the music, the music will take care of you." And if you're true to it, you are gonna get what you need. You just have to put all of it. You can't just put a little bit. You gotta put it all in there. Alot of these people who are struggling aren't putting it all in there. They are half doing it. They looking at it as a hobby or like a job. You gotta give it all man 130, 150, 200, not just a little bit.

Ian: They'd have to actually think nonlinearly, then.<br>
Louise: Imagine trying to write a long sentence with two hands, starting at either end. To do that, you'd have to know every single word you're going to write, and the space all of it occupies.

Weber: We have one question: what is their purpose here on Earth? It isn't complicated. Help me understand.<br>
Louise: Okay, so this is where we want to get. Right? This question: What is your purpose on Earth? To get there, we have to make sure they understand what a question is, and the nature of a request for information along with the response. Then there is clarifying the difference between a specific "you" from a collective "you." We don't want to know why Joe Alien is here, we want to know why all of them landed. Purpose requires an understanding of intent. Which means we have to find out if they make conscious choices or if their motivation is so instinctive they don't understand a "why" question, and biggest of all, we need to have enough of a vocabulary with them so we understand their answer.

Louise: In 1770, Captain James Cook's ship ran aground on the coast of Australia. He led a party into the country and met the aboriginal people. One of his sailors pointed to the animals that hopped around with their young in pouches, and asked what they were called. The aborigine replied "Kanguru."<br>

You did it because you don't think she deserves any more punishment than she's already had, and you couldn't take the chance that someone will lift her prints off the knife when they find it, which, if she goes through the naturalization process, she'll have to provide. You did it because there's not a lot of justice happening right now, and you had to make your own. What should we tell McT and Otero and Boyce?<br>
Vega: The truth. Nobody's going to notice one undocumented girl's name crossed off a court order.

Vega: Dalena, you know that killing a human being is not a good thing to do, right?<br>
Dalena(teenage sex worker): It was a good thing to do for those girls. They would have had a worse thing happen to them. What do you know? Nothing. You have money and guns. They had no home to go to anymore.<br>
Vega: They did. Catalina, Nati, Areceli, Maria Elena. Their fathers aren't in trouble anymore, and they came to get them. Maricel's and Dulce's fathers came with them, too. They were waiting for their daughters.<br>
Dalena: You're lying.<br>
Vega: I'm not.<br>
Dalena: My head is on fire.<br>
Vega looked at all of her: the dirt under her thumbnails, the vertical hash marks on her chapped lips, the natural gloss of her young skin, her long straight hair unbrushed but not matted, lying over her shoulders like a dark cloak. The terror in her eyes. Vega saw her living every second of what she had done again and feeling it slip away from her like a coin dropped off a cliff, deeper and further into the past, so far now she could not reach it even if she jumped in after it. Lost.<br>
Vega thought about reaching for Dalena's hands but thought better of it.<br>
So she said all she could say, which was "I know it is."

[Cap] had, in turn, been recalling the interactions with Mackey and then the Montalvo girls at the Surf Motel: how Mackey acted like an entitled little brat; how Chicago was just like Isabel Benitez, numb from trauma, train off the tracks; how none of the girls had thought to attempt escape even though they were only handcuffed to each other and not to some immovable object; how Nati asked for Dalena Cortez, and Cap was unexpectedly moved by that, heartened by the sign that the girls were looking out for one another.

Vega: I don't think we should wait that long, Commander. We know where Mackey is; Cap and I can bring him in.<br>
Commander Otero: Wait a second, let's think this through. Mackey is a trained agent, and we don't need this spinning into a hostage situation.<br>
Vega: It's already a hostage situation. He's holed up at a motel with the girls, and he's not thinking the clearest right now. If we have a lock on a location, we need to take advantage of it. I would rate Mackey pretty high on the possibility of flight risk.<br>
Otero: Ms. Vega, I realize no order I give you holds since you're not a police officer, but we are working together on this, and we need each other. I strongly advise waiting for us to get there so we can maximize the hances of a positive outcome.<br>
Cap: Fair enough. In two, three hours we'll meet you at the station and work out a strategy, unless you need us sooner.<br>
Otero: Not necessary. At the station, two or three hours.<br>
Vega: What the hell?[talking to Cap]<br>
Cap: Vega, do you really think I'm going to let those girls wait any longer? This is that half hour.<br>
Vega remembered saying it to him in the woods, which felt like ten years ago now...And even though they didn't know it when she kissed him, they could have died that day in the woods.<br>
Maybe they did, she thought now. Maybe they did get shot my meth heads that day, and everything since then was the last gasp of neurological activity before death. Maybe their bodies lay side by side in the woods, still under that cold, clear sky.<br>
Cap looked at her, something daring and young behind his eyes, and she knew they were not still in the woods. They were right here.

Otero glanced at Cap, as if to ask him to explain. Cap responded with a firm nod, crossed his arms to show his resolve.<br>
In truth, Cap didn't know Vega's exact plan, but like Otero, he had a message that kept coming back to him again and again in his life. It was always, without question: Trust the girl.

Rodrigo looked at Cap, and Cap wished he spoke Spanish so he could tell him this was the right thing, that he wouldn't regret it.<br>
This seemed to be a problem for Cap lately. Restrained by various barriers, unable to say the thing he really meant, so his message had to be truncated, simplified, rolled out plainly with no extra explanation.

"I'm thinking about motivations," [Vega] said. "How men pretty much have a triangle. Sex, drugs, money," she said, drawing a triangle in the air with her finger. "Every man who commits a criminal act does it in service to one or more of those three things."<br>
Then she thought about it a moment more, mentally scanning the lineup of skips and snatchers she'd come across, and added, "Most men, actually, do everything because of them." ... <br>
"I don't disagree," Cap said. "You gonna tell me what motivates women?"<br>
Vega thought. She watched her blanched reflection in the wind shield for clues and remembered the anguished face of the Brandt girls' mother.<br>

Emerson said, "Make your own Bible." Gather together all the poems and fragments and stuff that have shacken your spirit and sustained it. Create your own Bible. That's a job that we have, at least to me... Take responsibility for what we mean to be meaningful statements of being. Meaningful in the sense that we can walk in the darkness, our own darkness, stepping, and using these poems and songs and pieces of wisdom as solid footing for our journey. Where the journey is going, I'm sorry, nobody ever told me so.

We all want to be seen and heard. We all want to be appreciated, validated.<br>
Toni Morrison: When a kid walks in a room, your child or anybody else's child, does your face light up? That's what they're looking for. When my children used to walk in the room, I would look to make sure that their trousers were up... you think you're love is on display because you are caring for them, it's not. When they see you, they see the critical face... If you let your face speak what's in your heart... I was glad to see them... it's just as small as that.<br>
Oprah: That's how you learn what your value is: not what the person is saying to you, but what you feel.<br>
My own summary: if a child doesn't see that happy face when he/she enters, the room, they don't get that value, that validation. They can develop low self-esteem. For Oprah, she was validated and appreciated speaking in front of a stage and in front of teachers and churches.

Isabelle[Bourdin's wife] is sure that Bourdin[the chameleon] "can change." She said, "I've seen him now for two years, and he is not that person."<br>
At one point, Bourdin touched Isabelle's stomach. "My baby can have three arms and three legs," he said. "It doesn't matter. I don't need my child to be perfect. All I want is that this child feels love." He did not care what his family thought. "They are my shelter," he said of his wife and soon-to-be child. "No one can take that from me."<br>
A month later, Bourdin called and told me that his wife had given birth. "It's a girl," he said. He and Isabelle had named her Athena, for the Greek goddess. "I'm really a father," he said.<br>
I asked if he had become a new person. For a moment, he fell silent. Then he said, "No, this is who I am."

"I wish I had a real profession, something like the music business. I regret not being able to work steady and support my family. I have other regrets, too, but that's as much as one man can stand. Late at night, you lie in your bunk in prison and you think about what you lost, what you were, what you could've been, and you regret." ...

In December of 2017, almost two years after the funeral, Joanna, Max, and Alicia travelled by boat to South Georgia Island. "I wanted to go to the place Henry so loved," Joanna said.<br>
...<br>
A light snow was falling, and Joanna had wrapped herself in the down coat that Worsley had worn on his final expedition. "I felt as if he was walking beside me," she recalled.<br>
...<br>
At the chapel, Max, who had begun to contemplate attempting his own polar expedition, had recited the sonnet about Shackleton that his father had loved:<br>
All striving done and "life's set prize" attained:<br>
Not geographic goals, but greater far<br>
The pinnacles of leadership you gained.<br>
Joanna and her children dug a hole and buried Worsley's ashes in the frozen earth.

Long afterward, Max found himself waiting for his father to appear. "He was always the invincible man-- not physically but mentally-- and I still expect him to come back," he recalled. "I'm still waiting." Despite his grief, he was overwhelmed with pride when he thought of his father: "If I'm even half the man Dad turned out to be, I'd be so pleased." Whereas his father would ask himself, "What would Shacks do?," Max asked himself, "What would Dad do?"<br>
When the news of Worsley's death reached Great Britain, Prince William said, "We have lost a friend, but he will remain a source of inspiration to us all." The press hailed Worsley as "one of the world's great polar explorers" and a "hero from a bygone age." ... In a Facebook post, Nancy F. Koehn, the author of the book Ernest Shackleton, Exploring Leadership, wrote, "Worsley considered Shackleton his hero, and now we see Worsley as one of ours."

She caught the first flight out and arrived in Santiago, where she waited for a connecting flight to Punta Arenas. While she was in Santiago, she met the British ambassador to Chile, Fiona Clouder, who told Joanna that Henry's condition was grave. Joanna continued to get updates from the hospital, and was informed that his liver had failed. You can live without a liver, can't you? Joanna thought. Then she heard that his kidney had failed and thought, Can't you live without a kidney? Then, just before Joanna was to board the plane for Punta Arenas, the ambassador got a call from the British embassy. Afterward, Clouder knelt beside Joanna, held her hand, and said what Joanna already knew: Henry was dead.<br>
Accompanied by the ambassador, Joanna flew to Punta Arenas. She went past city streets and pedestrians, but didn't see anything; it was as if she were in a whiteout. She was taken into a church: light filtering through stained-glass windows, a cross on the wall. In front of her was an open wooden casket. Henry was inside. She had been told that several rock specimens had been found in his possession when he was evacuated, which was so like him: to carry them even as he was struggling to pull his weight. She looked down at his face. "I was completely terrified," she recalled. "But he looked incredibly peaceful. Almost happy." She leaned over and kissed him , his skin still warm.<br>
Joanna was filled with regrets. She wished that she had spoken to him before he had gone into surgery. She wished that he had abandoned his quest sooner, and that she had called ALE herself. "I'll feel guilty for the rest of my life," she said. She was facing "an absolute wall of pain," her own Antarctica.

From The White Darkness by David Grann<br>
He had already told Joanna of his decision, and she couldn't wait to see him and hold him. As she later noted, "Obviously, he will feel disappointed, but Shackleton never reached his goals, and what Henry has done is extraordinary." She notified Max and Alicia and many friends, all of whom expressed relief that he had decided to come home. Or, as Joanna thought of it: He chose us. ... Worsley was flown to ALE's base camp, on the other side of Antarctica, where, according to a company report, he was "talking happily about home and his upcoming lecturing engagement." That evening, he called Joanna and said, "I'm having a cup of tea and I'm going to be fine."<br>
"I love you so much," she said.<br>
"Darling, I love you too," he said, promising to call her the next morning.
	</p>

	<p id="207">
From The White Darkness by David Grann<br>
[Worsley] built his tent and collapsed inside. At one point, he called Max on the satellite phone, waking him in the middle of the night in France. All Henry kept saying was "I just want to hear your voice, I just want to hear your voice."<br>
Max told him, "You will always be a polar warrior in my eyes. You just need to pull out and come home."<br>
On the morning of January 21, Joanna spoke to him. He was suffering from, as she put it, "complete shutdown." He couldn't even muster the energy to boil water or to brush his teeth, and she pleaded with him to call ALE and evacuate. "You've absolutely got to call them," she said.<br>
He told her that, though he wasn't going to leave the tent, he needed some time to think through what to do next. He spent the day wresling with his predicament, wondering what Shacks would do. Worsley had written in his diary, "Just want it all to end," adding, "Miss everybody badly." But the GPS had informed him that he had finally passed the apex of the Titan Dome, and had started to descend. History was within his grasp. In his diary, he had written, "Never, ever give in." It echoed a lesson from one of the Shackleton self-help books, which Worsley had once posted on his website: "Never give up-- there's always another move."<br>
But maybe that was wrong. Hadn't Shackleton survived because he had realized that, at a certain point, he had no more moves and turned back? Unlike Scott and others who went to a polar grave, Shackleton reckoned with his own limitations and those of his men. He understood that not everything, least of all the Antarctic, can be conquered. And that within defeat there can still be triumph--the triumph of survival itself.<br>
On January 22, after seventy-one days and a trek of nearly eight hundred nautical miles, Worsley pushed the button and called for the most expensive taxi ride in the world. "Greetings, everybody," he said on his broadcast. "When my hero Ernest Shackleton walked ninety-seven miles from the South Pole on the morning of January 9, 1909, he said he'd shot his bolt." Worsley continued, "Well, today I have to inform with some sadness that I, too, have shot my bolt... My journey is at an end. I have run out of time and physical endurance-- and a simple, sheer inability to slide one ski in front of the other... My summit is just out of reach." But he sounded relieved: "I'll lick my wounds. I will heal over time, and I'll come to terms with the disappointment." ... He concluded, "This is Henry Worsley, signing off, at journey's end."
	</p>

	<p id="206">

"I may be drained of all power and energy," he reported on a broadcast. "But I still seem to have the will that says, to my heart and nerves and sinews, Hold on." He kept telling himself, "Keep your eyes on the prize." ... "But those I have to thank most are Joanna, Max, and Alicia." His voice cracked. "They have been with me every step of the way, each with a warm hand in the small of my back, lifting me when I am down, strengthening me when I am weak, and filling me when I'm empty. I owe them everything."

Alicia, [Worsley's daughter], had written [Worsley] him a note that quoted lyrics from The Jungle Book: "Look for the bare necessities/ The simple bare necessities/ Forget about your worries and your strife." ...

	</p>

Robert Swan, a British adventurer who had trekked to both poles, was monotoring Worsley's journey, and expressed awe at his daily progress... "Very, very rarely in your mind do you ever see the color green, for the simple reason if you're in green you're probably not pushing hard enough... You're thinking about your feet, your legs, your calves, your hips, your arms, your neck, your shoulders, and you're constantly doing these checks to see whether everything's OK... As Henry has said, as he moves towards those last few hours every day, you can feel that he's pushing into the red zone. And the red zone is not a place to stay in, because in the red zone your body is starting to eat itself. You're much more likely to get frostbite. So you live on the edge of the orange, occasionally push into the red, and then, very sensibly, he comes back off the red, back into the orange. And hopefully, when he's into his sleeping bag and speaking to us, you know he's back into the green."

He developed a rash on his groin. His feet were covered in bruises and blisters, and he took a knife to his boots, hoping to smooth the lining and alleviate the pain. One day, he suffered from a mysterious stomach ache, which was aggravated by the sled harness yanking at his waist. ... His diary entries became a litany of suffering: "hard day"; "a very difficult day"; "a brutal day"; "awful day-- floundering around in a complete whiteout"; "another awful day --worse than yesterday"; "swimming against a strong tide"; "still swimming against the tide"; "totally spent and demoralized." Each morning, he unzipped the flap of his tent and peeked out, hoping for clear skies, only to behold what he called "more of the white darkness." At times, he could not even discern the tips of his skis through the murk, which, he wrote, was as "thick as clotted cream."

"First few days really are hell-- never forget that," he wrote. If he focused on the length of his journey, he would never make it, and so he concentrated on immediate tasks. "It's just chipping away at it, bit by bit, and dealing with the moment," he later said on a broadcast.

While travelling alone, [Worsley] noted, "there is no one there to compare thoughts with and seek their opinions on, but I want to do this on my own." He later put the matter even more starkly: "Success or failure of this journey is completely up to me."

Henry, though, told Joanna that he would return to Antarctica only if she approved. He was sensitive to the toll that his expeditions had taken on their family. He often struggled to express his emotions-- the tumult that he had kept masked, even as it drove him-- and in his book he had included a passage that seemed intended for his family, a way to convey what he could not say directly. "Looking back now, I realize that I lost track of where my real priorities should lie," he wrote. "I can see now that I was not dividing up the time sensibly and making my family feel important and special." He went on, "Passion for something can so easily tip into obsession, which is a dangerous thing, especially when those affected are the very people who so loyally stand and wait." ... "Everyone dreams, but Dad's the guy who goes out and achives them," Max said.

Worsley didn't think that he would ever go back to Antarctica again. He happily returned to the Army and relished being with his family. But he gradually began to feel again the "lure of little voices." In his commonplace book, he wrote down a quote, from the Norwegian polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen, that seemed to address his own compulsion to subject himself to more suffering: "Why? On account of the great geographical discoveries, the important scientific results? Oh no; that will come later, for the few specialists. This is something all can understand. A victory of human mind and human strength over the dominion and powers of Nature; a deed that lifts us above the great monotony of daily life; a view over shining plains, with lofty mountains against the cold blue sky, and lands covered by ice-sheets of inconceivable extent... the triumph of the living over the stiffened realm of death." ... Worsley carved a message into the ice on his second expedition: I am the Antarctic.

Inside the tent on January 5, he opened the envelope that Joanna had given him. Some of the notes contained inspiring quotations, and he read aloud one from Winston Churchill: "We are masters of our fate, that the task which has been set before us is not above our strength; that its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance. As long as we have faith in our cause and an unconquerable will to win, victory will not be denied us."

Yet [Joanna] believed that, to borrow Thomas Pynchon's words, "Everyone has an Antarctic"-- someplace people seek to find answers about themselves. In the case of her husband, it was the Antarctic itself. And so she gave her blessing to the adventure, even though it threatened to take from her the man she loved.

"Beyond coping with the physical demands, I wanted to see if I had the mental strength," Worsley wrote, adding, "Any sign of quitting on this short event would spell disaster for the future challenge and, if I did give up... I would have to seriously consider my place in the expedition team."

[Shackleton] then faced a terrible quandary: he knew that he could reach the Pole in several days, capturing the grail, but if he kept going he would deplete the food the party needed for the return journey and jeopardize the lives of his men, who were already fading. Ultimately, Shackleton made what Worsley considered "the most selfless and astonishing decision ever in the history of polar exploration" -- he turned back.

It was twilight, and he could just make out the cairn and a granite tombstone, which was engraved with a paraphrase of a line by Robert Browning: "I hold that a man should strive to the uttermost for his life's set prize." ... After his trip to South eorgia, Worsley longed even more to make his own polar journey, to obtain his own "life's set prize," but he doubted that he ever would. As he put it, "I was afraid of the unknown-- the planning, the training, the fund-raising and, not least, the risk of failure."

And [Worsley] loved the way [Joanna] punctured his stoicism and exposed his hidden self, always urging him to "go out and achieve your dreams." For all her free-spiritedness, she was the steadiest presence in his life. He called her his "rock."

The motto was painted on the front of Worsley's sled, and he murmured it to himself like a mantra: "Always a little further...a little further." ... Whenever Worsley faced a perilous situation-- and he was now in more peril than he'd ever been-- he asked himself one question: What would Shacks do?

They had scrawled inspiring messages on his skis. One contained the adage "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts." Another, written by Joanna, said, "Come back to me safely, my darling." As is true of many adventurers, he seemed to be on an inward quest as much as an outward one-- the journey was a way to subject himself to an ultimate test of character.

From Buddha by Osamu Tezuka<br>
Buddha: The heart of man is always burning for what it desires! His pursuits bring tears, anger, and worry. Yet that can all vanish too! If, instead of shutting your eyes, you can seal your heart... you empty your thoughts and forget even yourself. Forget everything! Then your doubts and worries will disappear, you will suffer less not more, you will even merge with nature. There once was a flock of ducks in a pond. The pond had so few fish that the ducks were always starving...[Some ducks moved to a warmer and seemingly more comfortable place, the fire mountain. Some ducks moved to the sea, and some moved to human territory.] The winter was especially harsh. But the ducks in the pond stayed desire-less. Thinking nothing, hoping nothing, they kept still. They dreamed neither of tasty food nor of warm nests. Meanwhile, the ducks that made for the burning peak came to a bowl of fire and breathed noxious fumes...the tall waves came crashing against the ducks... the ducks that entered human territory were attacked... in the end, only the ducks in the pond lived on who'd not wish for more. Let me tell you another story. Once upon a time, there was a prosperous city, always busy, always aglow. At a distance, its lights had on hues of red and blue that seemed to beckon to travelers. People poured into the city drawn by the light. Once inside, it was always day in downtown, where ads and signs filled the streets. Dressed up women teased men for fancy dinners. Men hatched corrupt schemes just to make the extra cent. On the outskirts of the city, quite ignored, stood the lone house of a poor, shabby water-seller.<br>
Dad: We thank heaven for this meal.<br>
Boy: I'm sick of being poor! Can't you see those blue lights, those red lights outside our window? They sell everything there! They all live like kings! We're the only ones who're poor! I want us to move there and live like rich folks!<br>
Dad: No one in our family's sick. There's food on our table. What more do you want?<br>
Boy: Buy me a computer! I want a bicycle! I wanna watch movies! Every day!<br>
Dad: Hey, look at those cats and dogs. They don't need no popsicle to have a good time.<br>
[The boy runs away to the city alone.]
Boy: It smells so good. I wanna taste something yummy. How might I make money and eat good stuff? I know! I'll work at a restaurant. [He works at a restaurant.] I'll do anything owner! Anything beats selling water. So busy... so busy... [He was soon appointed manager.] I'll save up and buy my own restaurant someday. Then I'll really rake it in.<br>
Begger: Lad, spare me a drink.<br>
Boy: I've no time for beggers!<br>
Begger: Come, come. You have so much money.<br>
Boy: I earned it! Why should I share it with a stranger?<br>
Begger: How are you going to spend all that money?<br>
Boy: I'll buy fancy clothes, eat and drink well, and dance with girls!<br>
Begger: Okay, now take a peek into this gourd. Just take a look.<br>
Boy: Who's that in there? Why, it's me! I see myself in the gourd and I'm wrapped inblue flames.<br>
Begger: Those are the flames of desire. They're the glames of burning human desire.<br>
Boy: Wow. The fire's getting stronger.<br>
Begger: Because you're so attached to money and play. Now look at others. THey burn too... for success, for the deal, for riches, for fame, for leisure, for feasts... desire burns. Humans are all engulfed in desire.<br>
Boy: The fire's only getting stronger.<br>
Begger: I'm not surprised. Your desire seems bottomless. That fire is dangerous. In the end, it will burn you up.<br>
Boy: I don't believe you.<br>
Begger: As civilization progresses, so will desire; it's flames will only mount and cause various tragedies. In the end the whole world will perish. If humans want to survive, this fire must be put out. That means quenching all desire and living according to nature.<br>
Buddha: [The boy's restaurant is slower because another rival restaurant uses 5000 candles to attract customers. So they boy uses 10,000 candles. The rival increases their lights so the boy uses 50,000 candles. Then the boy wants to make a sign made of 100,000 candles. Then, the wind knocks over the candles and a fire spreads throughout the city, killing thousands of people. The boy survives and returns to his family. The boy stared at his father through the gourd.] And it's told that there wasn't a single flicker of blue fire on his father. Is the son better, or the father? You monks, should know the answer. Even a water-seller can rid himself of worry and desire and live according to nature. In the end, that wins! That was a parable, but it's the same for the crocodiles in that river. They eat to stay alive, and they desire nothing more and nothing less! That's the way to live. Think of yourself as a fire, and let all your desires and worries die out, just like a fire... you will then gain health, of mind and body alike.

Disciple: But the river's filled with crocodiles... here they are! Watch out, Buddha! They're the ones from last night!<br>
Buddha: Don't worry. We've become friends... These crocodiles were gracious enough to listen to what I had to say. I told them: I know you need to attack and devour creatures that enter the river, it's for your own survival. But if you try to eat any and all living things that come into the river, then they'll be frightened and avoid the river. You'll have little to eat and maybe even starve to death. The world works because we help one another.

Everything in this world is connected, one to another, in some way. All life long. You will have ties with many things as you live. Since that is true, why not leave things to nature?... What's important is that you yourself live rightly.

From Buddha by Osamu Tezuka<br>
Buddha: What torments humans? Illness, poverty, family, work, whatever it is, the torment comes through perception, the sense of smell, taste, sight, touch, and hearing. The remedy for such suffering is eightfold. And that is to see rightly, to think rightly, to speak rightly, to work rightly, to live rightly, to strive rightly, to pray rightly, and to stay right. We the living do not exist to be tormented, to suffer. But ascentics go out of their way with their ordeals, hurting themselves, making themselves suffer, and that's how some of them end their lives. It's no different from a dissolute life of pleasure where you do what pleases you. Both are wasted lives.

Is it important to someone else? Or is it important to many others? Is it important to your country? Is it important to the world? Is it vital to all living things, all nature? If it isn't, then you should stop. Because everyone in this world is connected.<br>
Disciple: But I've always lived without depending on anyone!<br>
Buddha: You eat three meals a day, no? Who cooks the meals? Who prepares the rice? In fact, the rice comes from a rice plant. So, simply by eating rice, you're depending on other living things and people. You can live only because others exist. No living thing lives on its own.

The truth is it is an incomparable creation. Could never write anything near as good. Now, I'm a spent firework, but at least I've been a firework. Watched my final sunrise, enjoyed a last cigarette.

You're a brilliant physicist but you couldn't understand, no matter how much I explained. I believe we do not stay dead long. As soon as my Luger lets me go, my birth, next time around will be on me in a heartbeat. There is another world waiting for us, Sixsmith. A better world and I'll be waiting for you there. Find me beneath the Corsican stars where we first kissed. Yours eternally, R.F. [The gun goes off.]

Goose: What's that, Ewing? How shall I comprehend if you drool and dribble so? Let me hazard a guess, then. Something in the key of, "Oh Henry, how could you do this to me? I thought we were friends?" Unfortunately, you are wrong, Adam. Wrong like Horrox and your silly father-in-law. There is only one rule that binds all people, one governing principle that defines every relationship on God's green earth. "The weak are meat and the strong do eat." Why, you ask. 'Tis absurdly simple. There is money in your trunk and I want it, so I have killed you for it. I commend you for a noble constitution, Adam. Most of my patrons succumb to my ministrations long before it comes to a drama such as this, but enough's enough, it is time for you to die.<br>

An-Kor Apis: Sonmi-451. I am sorely thankful to see you still alive and truly honored to meet you. I am general An-Kor Apis, leader of Union... I know you have many questions but let me begin with the how. Years ago a psychogenomicist named Yusouf Suleiman proved that Fabricants were capable of the same consciousness as any Pureblood. He was rewarded for the discovery of this scientific truth with imprisonment, execution and the eradication of any evidence suggesting the success of his experiment. A high ranking genomicist inside the Ministry of Science and Commerce is sympathetic to our cause. It was he that supplied us with Suleiman's formula. The rest of the details are superficial; the use of shells and intrigues to secure a legitimate research license, as well as the necessary front to instream the catalyst at Papa Song, all made legal by the unwitting help of a university doctoral candidate.<br>
Sonmi-451: Boom-Sook.<br>
An-Kor Apis: An unfortunate bit of collateral damage. I'm afraid the success of your sentience caught us all off guard.<br>
Sonmi-451: And Yoona?<br>
An-Kor Apis: A tragedy to be sure, that will be remembered only with the success of our revolution.<br>
Sonmi-451: General Apis... I am just a dinery server. I was not genomed to alter history.<br>
An-Kor Apis: No revolutionary ever was.<br>
Sonmi-451: I'm sorry. I can not do what you are asking.<br>
An-Kor Apis: I understand. It would be a difficult choice for anyone. But before you call your decision final, there is one last thing I'd like you to see. So you understand fully what we are fighting for.

Isaac: Exposition: The problem of the "actual past" and the "virtual past" can be illustrated by a historical event like the sinking of the Titanic. The disaster as it actually occurred fades into obscurity as witnesses die off, documents are destroyed and the wreck itself dissolves in its Atlantic grave. Yet a virtual sinking, created out of reworked memory, hearsay, fiction, in short- belief grows ever more "true." The virtual past is malleable, easily pressed into the service of the present as Powers vie for legitimacy and the right to control the actual and the virtual future. The uncreated and the dead exist in both the actual and virtual past. Symmetry demands that future creations and future selves wait to be influenced by our present self.

I knew the chances that she still lived in that house were practically silch and yet-- there she was. Ursula. My first real regret, like a first cigarette, that began a lifelong addiction. Why was I standing out here in the cold, cowering in the shadows? Why was I not in that room lit electric marigold?

I had a painting teacher once tell me that the difference between a 'good' painting and a 'great' painting is typically five strokes. And they are usually the five boldest strokes in the painting. The question of course is which five strokes?<br>
Ellie: I get it. After one's slaved away at making a "pretty good" painting, the last thing you'd want to do is make a bold stroke and potentially...<br>
Aster: Ruin everything. That's why I gave up painting. Still... I wonder if that is how I'm living my life. It's a 'pretty good' life. Probably the best life one could hope for in Squahamish.<br>
Ellie: Perhaps. But how well do you really know Squahamish?<br>
Aster: Everything beautiful is ruined eventually.<br>
Ellie: Maybe that's the thing. If you do ruin your painting, you gotta know you have everything in you to get to that 'pretty good' painting again. But if you never do the bold stroke, you'll never know if you could have had a great painting.<br>
Ellie[looking at Aster's painting and talking to Aster]: I like this stroke off to the side. Lonely. And hopeful.

From The Half Of It<br>
Ellie: Love isn't patient and kind and humble. Love is messy and horrible and selfish and bold. It's not finding your perfect half. It's the trying and reaching and failing-- it's the effort you put in-- when there's no guarantee of success. Love is being willing to ruin your good painting for a chance at a great one.[Ellie looks directly at Aster.] Is this really the boldest stroke you can make?

From The Half Of It<br>
Paul: Love isn't pretending. I know because I've been pretending. Only for a few weeks. But it sucks. And I've been thinking about how much it would suck to have to pretend to be-- not you-- your whole life. I always thought there was one way to love. One right way. But there's more. So many more than I knew. And I never want to be the guy who stops loving someone... for loving the way they want to love.

From the Walking Dead<br>
Rick: Our community is safe. The walls are strong, we can make a life here. But we need resources and a steady stream of supplies to keep us going. Maybe that's out there... other groups. Communities like ours... like he says. We could be scared of it, like I was at first. Or we can look at it as an opportunity, a way to keep us going, we could work with these people outh there, make our world safer, our lives better. It's safe behind those walls, but I think we've lost sight of what's out there on the other side...a larger world. Look at it... it's all around us, waiting on us to become a part of it again. We just have to be brave enough to accept it.

Introduction:... It's surprising that I've made a book because I'm not good at reading them. The truth is I need pictures, they are like islands, places to get to in a sea of words.<br>
This book is for everyone, whether you are eighty or eight-- I feel like I'm both sometimes.<br>
The boy is lonely when the mole first surfaces. They spend time together gazing into the wild. I think the wild is a bit like life-- frightening sometimes but beautiful.<br>
The boy is full of questions, the mole is greedy for cake. The fox is mainly silent and wary because he's been hurt by life.<br>
The horse is the biggest thing they have ever encountered, and also the gentlest.<br>
They are all different, like us, and each has their own weaknesses. I can see myself in all four of them, perhaps you can too.<br>
Their adventures happen in springtime where one moment snow is falling and the sun shines the next, which is also a little bit like life-- it can turn on a sixpence.<br>
I hope this book encourages you, perhaps, to live courageously with more kindness for yourself and for others. And to ask for help when you need it-- which is always a brave thing to do.<br>
When I was making the book I often wondered, who on earth am I to be doing this? But as the horse says: "the truth is everyone is winging it." So I say spread your wings and follow your dreams-- this book is one of mine. I hope you enjoy it and much love to you. Thank you. Charlie x

Asita: Naradatta, it is I, Asita. You sent me a messenger, Tatta by name, have you not? What folly! Listen well, you dunce! To save just one human, you mindlessly harnessed numerous beasts to an impossible task... and killed them one by one! The beasts you bent to your purpose all suffered greatly and died cruelly! You believe that human lives are sacrosanct while animal lives are worthless?!<br>
Naradatta: B-B-But I've saved Chapra!<br>

[Flashback - Shot of an army game like Risk.]<br>
GL12: Move. You've got to move Col. Your troops are across enemy lines.<br>
[Shot of Locke in an office break room.]<br>
LOCKE: Patience, the quality which you lack, GL12, is the hallmark of a leader.<br>
[Randy walks in the break room.]<br>
RANDY: Hallmark, huh? Tell me more about being a leader, Locke. While you're at it, tell me about this Col. thing. I cruised your file in human resources, you've never been in any of the armed forces.<br>
LOCKE: I'm just playing a game, Randy. It's my lunch hour, I can play a game.<br>
RANDY: Well, tell me, what's a Walkabout? [reading from a brochure]: "Experience the dream journeys of the fabled Australian Outback."<br>
LOCKE: You have no right taking that off my desk.<br>
RANDY: So, you wander around hunting and gathering food, right? On foot?<br>
LOCKE: Not that you would understand, but a Walkabout is a journey of spiritual renewal, where one derives strength from the earth. And becomes inseparable from it. I have vacation days, I'm going, Randy. I've already made a reservation.<br>
GL12: Wow. John you're really doing it, huh? You tell Helen yet?<br>
RANDY: Helen? Well, what's this Locke, you've actually got a woman in your life.<br>
LOCKE: That's none of your business.<br>
RANDY: What is it with you Locke? Why do you torture yourself? I mean, imagining you're some hunter? Walkabouts? Wake up, you can't do any of that.<br>

RANDY: What? Norman what?<br>
LOCKE: Norman Croucher. Norman Croucher, double amputee, no legs. He climbed to the top of Mt. Everest. Why? It was his destiny.<br>

[Near the end of episode 4]<br>
[Flashback - Travel agency office in Australia.]<br>
AGENT: The Walkabouts we arrange here are not just some stroll through the park. It's trekking across vast stretches of desert, rafting bloody treacherous waters.<br>
LOCKE: Look, you've got no idea who you're talking to. I'm well aware of what's involved, believe me. I probably know more than you on the subject.<br>
AGENT: In any case, it's a trying ordeal for someone in peak physical condition, let alone...<br>
LOCKE: Look, I booked this tour a month ago, you've already got my money. Now, I demand a place on that bus.<br>
AGENT: You misrepresented yourself...<br>
LOCKE: I never lied.<br>
AGENT: By omission, Mr. Locke. You neglected to tell us about your condition.<br>
LOCKE: My condition is not an issue. I've lived with it for 4 years. It's never kept me from doing anything.<br>
AGENT: Look, unfortunately it is an issue for our insurance company. I can't keep the bus waiting any longer. It isn't fair to the other people.<br>
LOCKE: Hey, don't talk to me about fair.<br>
AGENT: I can get you on a plane back to Sydney on our dime. That's the best I can do.<br>
LOCKE: No. I don't want to go back to Sydney. Look I've been preparing for this for years. Just put me on the bus, right now, I can do this.<br>
AGENT: No, you can't.<br>
LOCKE: Hey, hey, don't you walk away from me. [The wheelchair reveal]. You don't know who you're dealing with. Don't ever tell me what I can't do, ever. This is destiny. This is destiny. This is my destiny. (yelling) I'm supposed to do this, dammit. Don't tell me what I can't do. Don't tell me what I can't...<br>

Rick: It's not. Everything I've done, for the good of my group... has always mostly been done to protect my family. That's what's important to me. Pete was dangerous, he was hurting you... but if he's doing that, where does it end? Eventually that gets out to other people... puts them in danger. I'm just like everyone else--doing whatever I can to survive. If there's a difference maybe it's just that I see threats before anyone else... maybe even sometimes where there aren't any. I don't know... but don't get me wrong, and I'm glad I helped you... but I was doing it to keep my son safe. So I'm no better than those who didn't do a thing.<br>

	<p id="65">
From Matrix Reloaded<br>
Architect: Hello, Neo.<br>
Neo: Who are you?<br>
Architect: I am the Architect. I created the Matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and though the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant.<br>
Neo: Why am I here?<br>
Architect: Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the Matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which, despite my sincerest efforts, I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden assiduously avoided, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably… here.<br>
Neo: You haven't answered my question.<br>
Architect: Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others.<br>
TV Neos: Others? How many others? What others? Answer my question!<br>
Architect: The Matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the 6th version.<br>
TV Neos: 5 `One's before me? 4 3 2 What are you talking about?<br>
Neo: There are only two possible explanations, either no one told me, or no one knows.<br>
Architect: Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic – creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.<br>
TV Neos: You can't control me! I'm gonna smash you to bits! I'll fuckin' kill you!<br>
Neo: Choice. The problem is choice.<br>
Architect: The first Matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art – flawless, sublime. A triumph equalled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus the answer was stumbled upon by another – an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.<br>
Neo: The Oracle.<br>
Architect: Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99% of all test subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level. While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked, would constitute an escalating probablility of disaster.<br>
Neo: This is about Zion.<br>
Architect: You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed – its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.<br>
Neo: Bullshit.<br>
TV Neos: Bullshit!<br>
Architect: Denial is the most predictable of all human responses, but rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it. The function of the One is now to return to the Source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which, you will be required to select from the Matrix 23 individuals – 16 female, 7 male – to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash, killing everyone connected to the Matrix, which, coupled with the extermination of Zion, will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.<br>
Neo: You won't let it happen. You can't. You need human beings to survive.<br>
Architect: There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility of the death of every human being on this world. It is interesting, reading your reactions. Your 5 predecessors were, by design, based on a similar predication – a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the One. While the others experienced this in a very general way, your experience is far more specific – vis a vis love.<br>
Neo: Trinity.<br>
Architect: Apropos, she entered the Matrix to save your life, at the cost of her own.<br>
Neo: No.<br>
Architect: Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the anomaly revealed as both beginning and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the Source, and the salvation of Zion. The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice. But we already know what you are going to do, don't we? Already, I can see the chain reaction – the chemical precursors that signal the onset of an emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason – an emotion that is already blinding you from the simple and obvious truth. She is going to die, and there is nothing you can do to stop it.<br>
Architect: Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness.<br>
Neo: If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.<br>
Architect: We won't.

Soren: Then what do you need us for? Neo could take 'em both out easier than we could.<br>
Keymaker: There's no time.<br>
Niobe: Why?<br>
Keymaker: Once the door is unprotected, the connection will be severed. But another connection must first be made.<br>
Ghost: How long will that take?<br>
Keymaker: Exactly 314 seconds.<br>
Soren: Just over 5 minutes.<br>
Keymaker: That is the length and breadth of the window. Only The One can open the door, and only during that window can the door be opened.<br>
Niobe: How do you know all this?<br>
Keymaker: I know because I must know. It's my purpose. It's the reason I'm here. Same reason we're all here.<br>
Trinity: Neo, I know something's wrong. You don't have to tell me. I just want you to know that I'm here.<br>
Keymaker: All must be done as one.<br>
Link: Can't hurt.<br>
Keymaker: If one fails, all fail.<br>
Morpheus: All of our lives we have fought this war. Tonight I believe we can end it. Tonight is not an accident. There are no accidents. We have not come here by chance. I do not believe in chance when I see 3 objectives, 3 captains, 3 ships. I do not see coincidence, I see providence, I see purpose. I believe it is our fate to be here. It is our destiny. I believe this night holds for each and every one of us the very meaning of our lives.<br>
Neo: I want to ask you to do something, but I don't know how.<br>
Trinity: I promise you, if I can, I will.<br>
Neo: What if I asked you to stay out of this, no matter what. To stay out of the matrix?<br>
Trinity: Why?<br>
Neo: Please.<br>
Trinity: All right.<br>
Morpheus: What is it, Niobe?<br>
Niobe: I can't help it, Morpheus, I can't help thinking – what if you're wrong. What if all this – the prophecy, everything – is bullshit.<br>
Morpheus: Then tomorrow we may all be dead, but how would that be different from any other day? This is a war, and we are soldiers. Death can come for us at any time, in any place. Now consider the alternative. What if I am right? What if the prophecy is true? What if tomorrow the war could be over. Isn't that worth fighting for? Isn't that worth dying for?

Merovingian: Aha, here he is at last. Neo, the One himself, right? And the legendary Morpheus. And Trinity of course, si belle qu'elle me fait souffrir. I have heard so much, you honour me. Please, sit, join us. This is my wife, Persephone. Something to eat? Drink? Hmm… of course, such things are contrivances like so much here. For the sake of appearances.<br>
Neo: No, thank you.<br>
Merovingian: Yes, of course, who has time? Who has time? But then if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time? Château Haut-Brion 1959, magnificent wine, I love French wine, like I love the French language. I have sampled every language, French is my favourite – fantastic language, especially to curse with. Nom de Dieu de putain de bordel de merde de saloperies de connards d'enculés de ta mère. You see, it's like wiping your arse with silk, I love it.<br>
Morpheus: You know why we are here.<br>
Merovingian: Hmph… I am a trafficker of information, I know everything I can. The question is, do you know why you are here?<br><br>
Morpheus: We are looking for the Keymaker.<br>
Merovingian: Oh yes, it is true. The Keymaker, of course. But this is not a reason, this is not a `why.' The Keymaker himself, his very nature, is means, it is not an end, and so, to look for him is to be looking for a means to do… what?<br>
Neo: You know the answer to that question.<br>
Merovingian: But do you? You think you do but you do not. You are here because you were sent here, you were told to come here and you obeyed. [Laughs] It is, of course, the way of all things. You see, there is only one constant, one universal, it is the only real truth: causality. Action. Reaction. Cause and effect.<br>
Morpheus: Everything begins with choice.<br>
Merovingian: No. Wrong. Choice is an illusion, created between those with power, and those without. Look there, at that woman. My God, just look at her. Affecting everyone around her, so obvious, so bourgeois, so boring. But wait… Watch – you see, I have sent her dessert, a very special dessert. I wrote it myself. It starts so simply, each line of the program creating a new effect, just like poetry. First, a rush… heat… her heart flutters. You can see it, Neo, yes? She does not understand why – is it the wine? No. What is it then, what is the reason? And soon it does not matter, soon the why and the reason are gone, and all that matters is the feeling itself. This is the nature of the universe. We struggle against it, we fight to deny it, but it is of course pretense, it is a lie. Beneath our poised appearance, the truth is we are completely out of control. Causality. There is no escape from it, we are forever slaves to it. Our only hope, our only peace is to understand it, to understand the `why.' `Why' is what separates us from them, you from me. `Why' is the only real social power, without it you are powerless. And this is how you come to me, without `why,' without power. Another link in the chain. But fear not, since I have seen how good you are at following orders, I will tell you what to do next. Run back, and give the fortune teller this message: Her time is almost up. Now I have some real business to do, I will say adieu and goodbye.<br>
Neo: This isn't over.<br>
Merovingian: Oh yes, it is. The Keymaker is mine and I see no reason why I should give him up. No reason at all.<br>
Persephone: Where are you going?<br>
Merovingian: Please, ma chérie, I've told you, we are all victims of causality. I drink too much wine, I must take a piss. Cause and effect. Au revoir.<br>
Trinity: Touch me, and that hand will never touch anything again.

Councillor West: Comprehension is not a requisite of cooperation.<br>
Lock: You're asking me to order two of my captains…<br>
Councillor Dillard: There's no need for such an order, the Captains are present – they can answer for themselves. The Council is calling for two volunteers to aid the Nebuchadnezzar. Are there two among you that would answer such a call?<br>

Smith: Then you're aware of it.<br>
Neo: Of what?<br>
Smith: Our connection. I don't fully understand how it happened. Perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me, something overwritten or copied. That is at this point irrelevant, what matters is that whatever happened, happened for a reason.<br>
Neo: And what reason is that?<br>
Smith: I killed you, Mister Anderson, I watched you die… With a certain satisfaction, I might add, and then something happened. Something that I knew was impossible, but it happened anyway. You destroyed me, Mister Anderson. Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood what I was supposed to do but I didn't. I couldn't. I was compelled to stay, compelled to disobey. And now here I stand because of you, Mister Anderson, because of you I'm no longer an agent of the system, because of you I've changed – I'm unplugged – a new man, so to speak, like you, apparently free.<br>
Neo: Congratulations.<br>
Smith: Thank you. But as you well know, appearances can be deceiving, which brings me back to the reason why we're here. We're not here because we're free, we're here because we're not free. There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose – because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist.<br>

Smith 3: Purpose that connects us,<br>
Smith 4: Purpose that pulls us,<br>
Smith 5: That guides us,<br>

The Oracle: Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite ya. Come around here, and let me have a look at ya. My goodness, look at you! You turned out all right, didn't you? How do you feel?<br>
Neo: I, uh…<br>
The Oracle: I know you're not sleeping. We'll get to that. Why don't you come and have a sit this time?<br>
Neo: Maybe I'll stand.<br>
The Oracle: Well, suit yourself.<br>
Neo: I felt like sitting.<br>
The Oracle: I know. So. Let's get the obvious stuff out of the way.<br>
Neo: You're not human, are you?<br>
The Oracle: Well it's tough to get any more obvious than that.<br>
Neo: If I had to guess, I'd say you're a program from the machine world. So is he.<br>
The Oracle: So far, so good.<br>
Neo: But if that's true, that can mean you are a part of this system, another kind of control.<br>
The Oracle: Keep going.<br>
Neo: I suppose the most obvious question is, how can I trust you?<br>
The Oracle: Bingo! It is a pickle, no doubt about it. The bad news is there's no way if you can really know whether I'm here to help you or not. So it's really up to you. You just have to make up your own damn mind to either accept what I'm going to tell you, or reject it. Candy?<br>
Neo: D'you already know if I'm going to take it?<br>
The Oracle: Wouldn't be much of an Oracle if I didn't.<br>
Neo: But if you already know, how can I make a choice?<br>
The Oracle: Because you didn't come here to make the choice, you've already made it. You're here to try to understand why you made it. I thought you'd have figured that out by now.<br>
Neo: Why are you here?<br>
The Oracle: Same reason. I love candy.<br>
Neo: But why help us?<br>
The Oracle: We're all here to do what we're all here to do. I'm interested in one thing, Neo, the future. And believe me, I know – the only way to get there is together.<br>
Neo: Are there other programs like you?<br>
The Oracle: Oh, well, not like me. But… Look, see those birds? At some point a program was written to govern them. A program was written to watch over the trees, and the wind, the sunrise, and sunset. There are programs running all over the place. The ones doing their job, doing what they were meant to do, are invisible. You'd never even know they were here. But the other ones, well, we hear about them all the time.<br>
Neo: I've never heard of them.<br>
The Oracle: Of course you have. Every time you've heard someone say they saw a ghost, or an angel. Every story you've ever heard about vampires, werewolves, or aliens is the system assimilating some program that's doing something they're not supposed to be doing.<br>
Neo: Programs hacking programs. Why?<br>
The Oracle: They have their reasons, but usually a program chooses exile when it faces deletion.<br>
Neo: And why would a program be deleted?<br>
The Oracle: Maybe it breaks down. Maybe a better program is created to replace it – happens all the time, and when it does, a program can either choose to hide here, or return to The Source.<br>
Neo: The machine mainframe?<br>
The Oracle: Yes. Where you must go. Where the path of The One ends. You've seen it, in your dreams, haven't you? The door made of light?<br>
Neo: [nods] The Oracle: What happens when you go through the door?<br>
Neo: I see Trinity, and something happens, something bad. She starts to fall, and then I wake up.<br>
The Oracle: Do you see her die?<br>
Neo: No.<br>
The Oracle: You have the sight now, Neo. You are looking at the world without time.<br>
Neo: Then why can't I see what happens to her?<br>
The Oracle: We can never see past the choices we don't understand.<br>
Neo: Are you saying I have to choose whether Trinity lives or dies?<br>
The Oracle: No. You've already made the choice, now you have to understand it.<br>
Neo: No, I can't do that. I won't.<br>
The Oracle: You have to.<br>
Neo: Why?<br>
The Oracle: Because you're The One.<br>
Neo: What if I can't? What happens if I fail?<br>
The Oracle: Then Zion will fall. Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo. You can save Zion if you reach The Source, but to do that you will need the Keymaker.<br>
Neo: The Keymaker?<br>
The Oracle: Yes, he disappeared some time ago. We did not know what happened to him until now. He's being held prisoner by a very dangerous program, one of the oldest of us. He is called the Merovingian, and he will not let him go willingly.<br>
Neo: What does he want?<br>
The Oracle: What do all men with power want? More power.<br>
The Oracle: Be there, at that exact time, and you will have a chance.<br>
Seraph: We must go.<br>
The Oracle: Seems like every time we meet I've got nothing but bad news. I'm sorry about that, I surely am. But for what it's worth, you've made a believer out of me. Good luck, kiddo.

Councillor Hamann: It's a good sign.<br>
Neo: Of what?<br>
Councillor Hamann: That you are, in fact, still human. Have you ever been to the enginering level? I love to walk there at night, it's quite amazing. Would you like to see it?<br>
Neo: Sure.<br>
Councillor Hamann: Almost no one comes down here, unless, of course, there's a problem. That's how it is with people – nobody cares how it works as long as it works. I like it down here. I like to be reminded this city survives because of these machines. These machines are keeping us alive, while other machines are coming to kill us. Interesting, isn't it? Power to give life, and the power to end it.<br>
Neo: We have the same power.<br>
Councillor Hamann: I suppose we do, but down here sometimes I think about all those people still plugged into the Matrix and when I look at these machines, I.. I can't help thinking that in a way, we are plugged into them.<br>
Neo: But we control these machines, they don't control us.<br>
Councillor Hamann: Of course not, how could they? The idea's pure nonsense, but… it does make one wonder just… what is control?<br>
Neo: If we wanted, we could shut these machines down.<br>
Councillor Hamann: Of course… that's it. You hit it! That's control, isn't it? If we wanted, we could smash them to bits. Although if we did, we'd have to consider what would happen to our lights, our heat, our air.<br>
Neo: So we need machines and they need us. Is that your point, Councillor?<br>
Councillor Hamann: No, no point. Old men like me don't bother with making points. There's no point.<br>
Neo: Is that why there are no young men on the Council?<br>
Councillor Hamann: Good point.<br>
Neo: Why don't you tell me what's on your mind, Councillor?<br>
Councillor Hamann: There is so much in this world that I do not understand. See that machine? It has something to do with recycling our water supply. I have absolutely no idea how it works. But I do understand the reason for it to work. I have absolutely no idea how you are able to do some of the things you do, but I believe there's a reason for that as well. I only hope we understand that reason before it's too late.<br>

[Kate sewing up Jack's wound.]<br>
KATE: I might throw up on you.<br>
JACK: [shaking his head] You're doing fine.<br>
KATE: You don't seem afraid at all. I don't understand that.<br>
JACK: Well, fear's sort of an odd thing. When I was in residency, my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 16 year old kid, a girl. And at the end, after 13 hours, I was closing her up and I, I accidentally ripped her dural sac. Shredded the base of the spine where all the nerves come together, membrane as thin as tissue. And so it ripped open. And the nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta, spinal fluid flowing out of her and I … And the terror was just so … crazy. So real. And I knew I had to deal with it. (He's crying). So I just made a choice. I'd let the fear in, let it take over, let it do its thing, but only for five seconds, that's all I was going to give it. So I started to count: One, two, three, four, five. Then it was gone. I went back to work, sewed her up and she was fine.<br>
KATE: If that had been me, I think I would have run for the door.<br>
JACK: No, I don't think that's true. You're not running now.

Rick(at Dale's funeral): Dale has me rethinking a lot of things. He resisted things that I deemed necessary. He wouldn't allow himself to be completely changed by his surroundings. I thought that made him weak, but maybe I was wrong. Maybe he was strong to resist those urges. Maybe he was stronger than any of us to hold onto his humanity and refuse to let it go. What we've done to survive... sometimes I feel like we're no better than the dead ones.

Rick: Well, let's have it then, old man. What's on your mind?<br>
Dale: Don't put your guard up. I hope this isn't too much of a let down. But I just wanted to say thank you.<br>
Rick: For what?<br>
Dale: "For what?," He says! Being the "leader" of our little group... even when we didn't want you to be... it was never about bossing people around. It was never about control. The decisions you had to make, the consequences of those decisions-- none of us were prepared to carry that burden. Nobody wanted the responsibility. You didn't want it--but you took it just the same. I have to admit, I thought you were dangerous... I blamed you for a lot of what happened. But sitting here, at the end, thinking back... it's easy to blame you for what happened at times--and that's your burden for taking control--for taking care of strangers--trying to protect us. It's not as easy to give you credit for things that didn't happen. A lot of people are dead... but look at how long this group has lasted. I think that's your fault, too. You helped me last this long, gave me the time I had with the boys, with Andrea... and I appreciate that very much... so thank you.

I think of the many honorable people who work for the organization. Truman was in the PPD. Mike Dipaolo still is. Davis Nguyen. Gloria Peters. Even Denise Chambers, who recently phone me personally to apologize.<br>
Then there are the Laffertys, the evil ones. They're few and far between, but everybody's met one.<br>
The hardest cases, I think--perhaps the most dangerous ones--are the friends of the Laffertys'. People like Sergeant Aheard, who has possibly known for years about what goes on in Kensington. Maybe he even participates himself--who knows. And he'll never be fired, never be questioned, never even be disciplined. He'll go on with his daily routine, showing up for work, casually abusing his power in ways that will have lasting effects on individuals and communities, on the whole city of Philadelphia, for years.<br>
It's the Ahearns of the world who scare me.<br>
I still don't have a job. I probably could have gotten a lawyer and sued the PPD, given all that happened, but I don't have the inclination.<br>
Instead, I live on unemployment. I work at my uncle Rich's car dealership in Frankford, doing paperwork and answering phones, being paid under the table, all cash. With a more regular schedule, I have found a regular babysitter, someone I trust, to watch Thomas two days a week now. Mondays and Wednesdays, I bring Thomas with me to Rich's. And Fridays, Mrs. Mahon watches him.<br>
The system isn't perfect, but it's working for now. Next year, Thomas will go to kindergarten, and everything will change again. Maybe I'll sign up for classes at the community college. Maybe, eventually, I'll get a degree. Be a history teacher, like Ms. Powell. Maybe.<br>
When I get it, I tell myself, I'll frame it, and then send a copy to Gee.

When I think about Kacey, when I wonder whether she will find the strength and luck and perseverance to get and stay clean, it is these souls I think of first. How few ever seem to make it out. I think of the Piper, the whole town of Hamelin, shocked in his wake, abandoned and condemned.<br>
But then I look at Kacey--who comes to visit most Sundays now, who at this moment is sitting on my couch, who on this day has 189 days clean--and think, maybe she'll be one of the few. The veteran of some war, wounded but alive. Maybe Kacey will outlive us all, will live to be a hundred and five. Maybe Kacey will be all right.<br>
Letting hope back in feels right and wrong all at once. Like letting Thomas sleep in my bed when he really should sleep in his.<br>
Like letting him meet the woman who brought him into the world.<br>
Like breaking an oath of loyalty when you know a secret needs telling.

Kacey looks at me for a long time, searching my face.<br>
Then she looks past me, toward the corner, toward Alonzo's store. She's frozen. I turn, finally, to see what she sees, but no one is there. And I know, without asking, that Kacey is picturing Paula Mulroney standing there, one leg propped up against the wall, cocky, smiling, her usual stance.<br>
--They were my friends, says Kacey, quietly now. All of them. Even the ones I didn't know.<br>
--I'm sorry, I say at last.<br>
She doesn't reply.<br>
--Kacey, I'm sorry, I say again.<br>
But the El train is going by now, and I don't know if my sister can hear me.

--I told you, says Kacey. I knew when he found out that Eddie Lafferty might be the one killing those women, he wouldn't stand for it. I know him.<br>
I shake my head. I notice, suddenly, that Kacey looks unsteady and pale. She has her hands on her stomach. She is six months pregnant, now, and seems to feel it. I don't know if she'll make it the whole way. She keeps insisting she's fine, but she's bent forward slightly. How long has it been, I wonder, since her last dose of methadone?<br>
--Are you okay? I ask her.<br>
--Fine, Kacey says, tightly.<br>
We walk in silence a little longer. Then she goes on.<br>
--Connor can do bad things, Kacey says, but he's not all bad. Almost nobody is.<br>
I have nothing to say to this. I picture Mrs. Mahon, her hand tipping back and forth in the air above the chessboard. They're bad and good both, all the pieces. It is possible to acknowledge, on some level, the truth of this. And yet I hate Connor McClatchie for what he did to my sister. And I know, without a doubt, that I'll never forgive him.

Michonne: But you did it. No one else. And you didn't just do what was "right" you did what you thought was right. And what you thought was right ended up being right. You saved that girl's life.<br>

"What was the question?" Vega said, sounding genuine.<br>

McKie screamed again and tried to turn onto his back and cover his abdomen with his bloody hand.<br> 
"Who am I, right? Right? Right?"<br> 
She held her foot right over his face, let it hover. And then she said what Perry had taught her-- someone asks who you are, you tell them the only thing they need to know:<br> 
"I'm the motherfucker who gets. Shit. Done."<br> 
Then she kicked him once more in the face, and he was out.

V(Evey): "Give me a viking funeral," you said. That isn't much. That isn't much to ask. Not after all you did. You came out of an abattoir unharmed, but not unchanged. And saw freedom's necessity; not just for you, but for us all. You saw, and seeing, dared to do. How purposeful was your vendetta, how benign, almost like surgery. Your foes assumed you sought revenge upon their flesh alone, but you did not stop there. You gored their ideology as well. The people stand within the ruins of society, a jail intended to outlive them all. The door is open. They can leave, or fall instead to squabbling and thence new slaveries. The choice is theirs, as ever it must be. I will not lead them, but I'll help them build. Help them create where I'll not help them kill. The age of killers is no more. They have no place within our better world. "Give me a viking funeral," you said. It's yours, my love... it's yours.

V(Evey): Good evening, London. I would introduce myself, but truth to tell, I do not have a name. You can call me "V." Since mankind's dawn, a handful of oppressors have accepted the responsibility over our lives that we should have accepted for ourselves. By doing so, they took our power. By doing nothing, we gave it away. We've seen where their way leads, through camps and wars, towards the slaughterhouse. In anarchy, there is another way. With anarchy, from rubble comes new life, hope reinstated. They say anarchy's dead, but see... reports of my death were exaggerated. Tomorrow, Downing Street will be destroyed, the head reduced to ruins, an end to what has gone before. Tonight, you must choose what comes next. Lives of our own, or a return to chains. Choose carefully. And so, adieu.

Finch(main detective): People need symbols, Dominic. He understood that, we've forgotten it. Those people outside lost families during the war. We've kept the lid on their bitterness for years, but we haven't helped them deal with it. Maybe he didn't either, but he certainly took the lid off... just like Larkhill did for me. Everything's different now, Dominic. I don't belong here anymore.<br>
Dominic: You're going? Mr. Finch, listen, it's the drugs...<br>
Finch: Susan's dead, with Creedy and Heyer dividing his carcass. They're not hallucinations. Neither was the war. I lost my family, and thought following orders could heal that. It can't. I'm following my own orders now, and getting out before everything blows, perhaps you should, too. Goodbye Dominic. Take care, lad.

V: First, you must discover whose face lies behind this mask, but you must never know my face. Is that quite clear?<br>
Evey (inner thoughts): No. No, it isn't clear at all. V, you wouldn't die and leave me in all this confusion, so you can't be dead. That's all there is to it. I'm going to walk up these stairs and through that door and you'll be alive and it will be just another mean trick, another part of my education. No hanging back. Straight up the stairs, straight through the door, and... So. Dead then. Oh christ, what happens next? You never said. You never said what you were educating me for. You never told me what I'm supposed to do. All right. All right, then, what I do is this: I walk towards the body, very quietly, very reverently... and I stoop down, my fingers struggle clumsily with elasticated straps... and then I take off the mask...No. No, that isn't what I do. What I do is, in tears I stumble over to the corpse. It's slippery with blood beneath my fingers, but I tear the mask aside, and... No. No. That's not it. Because you were so big, V, and what if you're just nobody? Or even if you're someone, you'll be smaller, cause of all the people that you could have been but weren't. Oh, I don't know. I don't know what I mean. Just do it. There's no reason why I shouldn't. No one here to stop me. I'll just walk across the floor and take hold of the mask, and... No. No, I'm past that one. You weren't my dad. I know that. Even if you were, it wouldn't be enough. If I take off that mask, something will go away forever, be diminished because whoever you are isn't as big as the idea of you, but... but... you said I had to, that I had to know... so I start walking towards the body, trying not to tread in all the blood. It doesn't move. It doesn't look much like a person anymore. Something has gone from it. I kneel, my hands are trembling, I can hardly find the fastenings, but finally I lift away that maddening smile, and... [a mask looking like Evey]... and at last I know. I know who V must be.

V: You asked for knowledge, Eve, and that is what I shall pass on to you. Knowledge, like air, is vital to life. Like air, no one should be denied it...I've been teaching you to breathe.<br>
Evey: Are these rooms connected?<br>
V: Everything is connected. You must understand that knowledge is not all your heritage. It includes also courage and belief, like hers that we commemorate herein... and romance. Always, always romance. Midst insurrection's clamour, we may easily forget just what it is for which we strive. Isn't it dancing? Scented shoulders? Pupils widened by desire or wine? Anarchy must embrace the din of bombs and cannon-fire... yet always must it love sweet music more...<br>
V: Unlike t.v, we cannot have too much of science, despite its nuclear quirks. With science, ideas can germinate within a bed of theory, form, and practice that assists their growth... but we, as gardeners, must beware... for some seeds are the seeds of ruin... and the most iridescent blooms are often the most dangerous.<br>
V: Anarchy wears two faces, both creator and destroyer. Thus destroyers topple empires; make a canvas of clean rubble where creators can then build a better world. Rubble, once achieved, makes further ruins means irrelevant. Away with our explosives, then! Away with our destroyers! They have no place within our better world. But let us raise a toast to all our bombers, all our bastards, most unlovely and most unforgivable. Let's drink to their health... then meet with them no more.

A few might take the opportunity to protest, but it'll just be a voice crying in the wilderness. Noise is relative to the silence preceding it. The more absolute the hush, the more shocking the thunderclap. Our masters have not heard the people's voice for generations, Evey... and it is much much louder thatn they care to remember.

V: Don't you? Your lover lived in the penitentiary that we are all born into, and was forced to rake the drecs of that world for his living. He knew affection and tenderness but only briefly. Eventually, one of the other inmates stabbed him with a cutlass and he drowned upon his own blood. Is that it, Evey? Is that the happiness worth more than freedom?<br>
Evey: How did you know? How did you know what happened to Gordon?<br>
V: It's not an uncommon story, Evey. Many convicts meet with miserable ends. Your mother. Your father. Your lover. One by one. Taken out behind the chemical sheds... and shot. All convicts, hunched and deformed by the smallness of their cells, the weight of their chains; the unfairness of their sentences... I didn't put you in a prison, Evey. I just showed you the bars.<br>

Evey: Shut up! You're mad! I don't want to hear it!<br>
V: That's because you're afraid, Evey. You're afraid because you can feel freedom closing in upon you. You're afraid because freedom is terrifying.<br>
Evey: I can't feel anything! There's nothing to feel! Leave me alone!<br>
V: Don't back away from it, Evey. Part of you understands the truth even as part pretends not to. Woman, this is the most important moment of your life. Don't run from it.<br>

Valerie: I don't know who you are. Please believe. There is no way I can convince you that this is not one of their tricks, but I don't care. I am me, and I don't know who you are but I love you. I have a pencil, a little one they did not find. I am a woman. I hid it inside me perhaps I won't be able to write again, so this is a long letter about my life. It is the only autobiography I will ever write and oh God I'm writing it on toilet paper. I was born in Nottingham in 1957, and it rained a lot. I passed my eleven plus and went to girl's grammar. I wanted to be an actress. I met my first girlfriend at school. Her name was Sara. She was fourteen and I was fifteen but we were both in miss Watson's class. Her wrists. Her wrists were beautiful. I sat in biology class, staring at the pickled rabbit fetus in its jar, listening while Mr. Hird said it was an adolescent phase that people outgrew... Sara did. I didn't. In 1976 I stopped pretending and took a girl called Christine home to meet my parents. A week later, I moved to London, enrolling at drama college. My mother said I broke her heart... but it was my integrity that was important. Is that so selfish? It sells for so little, but it's all we have left in this place. It is the very last inch of us... but within that inch we are free!<br>
Captain: Alright. Now, Miss Hammond, let's review the facts. You work for codename V. Codename V kills security officers. Peter Creedy is a security officer. He frequents the Kitty Kat Keller. You were found outside the establishment with a loaded gun. You were planning to murder Mr. Creedy, under the orders of codename V. Isn't that what happened, Miss Hammond?<br>
Evey: No! No, please that isn't true...<br>
Captain: Oh dear Rossiter.
Rossiter: Sir.
Evey: No! Wait! Please don't. (Evey gets waterboarded.)<br>
Valerie: London, I was happy in London... I saw a lot of the scene, but I never felt comfortable there. So many of them just wanted to be gay, it was their life, their ambition, all they talked about. No! I wanted more than that. Work improved. I got small film roles, then bigger ones. In 1986 I starred in the Salt Flats! It pulled in the awards but not the crowds. I met Ruth while working on that. We loved each other. We lived together, and on Valentine's day she sent me roses, and oh God, we had so much. Those were the best three years of my life. In 1988 there was the war and after that there were no more roses. Not for anybody. In 1992, after the take-over, they started rounding up the gays. They took Ruth while she was out looking for food. Why are they so frightened of us? They burned her with cigarette ends and made her give them my name. She signed a statement saying I'd seduced her. I didn't blame her. God. I loved her. I didn't blame her. But she did. She killed herself in her cell. She couldn't live with betraying me, with giving up that last inch. Oh Ruth. They came for me. They told me that all my films would be burned. They shaved off my hair. They held my head down a toilet bowl and told jokes about lesbians. They brought me here and gave me drugs. I can't feel my tongue anymore. I can't speak. The other gay woman here, Rita, died two weeks ago. I imagine I'll die quite soon. It is strange that my life should end in such a terrible place, but for three years I had roses and I apologised to nobody. I shall die here, every inch of me shall perish... except one. An inch. It's small and it's fragile and it's the only thing in the world that's worth having. We must never lose it, or sell it, or give it away. We must never let them take it from us. I don't know who you are, or whether you're a man or woman. I may never see you. I will never hug you or cry with you or get drunk with you. But I love you. I hope that you escape this place. I hope that the world turns and that things get better, and that one day people have roses again. I wish I could kiss you.<br>
Captain: "My name is Eve Hammond. On the fifth of November, 1997, I was abducted by the terrorist known as codename 'V' and then taken against my will to an unknown location. Once there, I was systematically brainwashed by means of drugs and torture, both physical and psychological. I was frequently subjected to sexual abuse during this period. Eventually, I was terrorized into helping him commit murders. These included the unlawful killings of Mr. Roger Dascombe, Mr. Derek Almond, Dr. Delia Surridge and the Reverend Anthony Lilliman, bishop of Westminster. I also undertook the attempted murder of Mr. Peter Creedy. I, the undersigned, swear that the above statement is genuine, and that it was not signed by means of intimidation." We'd like you sign that for us, Miss Hammond. Where we've put the little cross...<br>
Evey: No.<br>
Captain: As you wish. Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell Rossiter, where she will wait while you arrange a wet detail of six men...then take her out behind the chemical sheds and shoot her.<br>
Rossiter: It's time... unless you want to change your mind. Sign that statement. You could be out inside three years. Perhaps they'd find you a job with the Finger. A lot of your sort get work with the Finger.<br>

Almost ten thousand years! My word, doesn't time fly? It seems like only yesterday... I remember the day you commenced your employment, swinging down from the trees, fresh-faced and nervous, a bone clasped in your bristling fist... "Where do I start, sir?" you asked, plaintively. I recall my exact words: "There's a pile of dinosaur eggs over there, youngster," I said, smiling paternally the while. Well, we've certainly come a long way since then, haven't we? And yes, yes, you're right, in all that time you haven't missed a day.Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Also, please don't think I've forgotten about your outstanding service record, or about all of the invaluable contributions that you've made to the company... fire, the wheel, agriculture... it's an impressive list, old-timer. A jolly impressive list. Don't get me wrong. But... well, to be frank, we've had our problems too. There's no getting away from it. Do you know what I think a lot of it stems from? I'll tell you... it's your basic unwillingness to get on within the company. You don't seem to want to face up to any real responsibility, or to be your own boss. Lord knows, you've been given plenty of opportunities... we've offered you promotion time and time again, and each time you've turned us down. "I couldn't handle the work, guv'nor," you wheedled. "I know my place." To be frank, you're not trying, are you? You see, you've been standing still for far too long. And it's starting to show in your work... and, I might add, in your general standard of behavior. The constant bickering on the factory floor has not escaped my attention... nor the recent bouts of rowdiness in the staff canteen. Then of course there's... hmm. Well, I didn't really want to have to bring this up, but... well, you see, I've been hearing some disturbing rumors about your personal life. No, never you mind who told me. No names, no pack drill... I understand that you are unable to get on with your spouse. I hear that you argue. I am told that you shout. Violence has been mentioned. I am reliably informed that you always hurt the one you love... the one you shouldn't hurt at all. And what about the children? It's always the children who suffer, as you're well aware. Poor little mites. What are they to make of it? What are they to make of your bullying, your despair, your cowardice and all your fondly nurtured bigotries? Really, it's not good enough, is it? And it's no good blaming the drop in work standards upon bad management, either... though, to be sure, the management is very bad. In fact, let us not mince words... the management is terrible! We've had a string of embezzlers, frauds, liars and lunatics making a string of catastrophic decisions. This is plain fact. But who elected them? It was you! You who appointed these people! You who gave them the power to make your decisions for you! While I'll admit that anyone can make a mistake once, to go on making the same lethal errors century after century seems to me nothing short of deliberate. You have encouraged these malicious incompetents, who have made your working life a shambles. You have accepted without question their senseless orders. You have allowed them to fill your workspace with dangerous and unproved machines. You could have stopped them. All you had to say was "No." You have no spine. You have no pride. You are no longer an asset to the company. I will, however, be generous. You will be granted two years to show me some improvement in your work. If at the end of that time you are still unwilling to make a go of it... you're fired. That will be all. You may return to your labours.

Dr. Delia: When I saw you that night... the night you escaped. You were standing against the flames. You turned and you looked straight at me. I knew then that one day you'd come looking for me, that you'd find me. What... what we did, what I did at Larkhill... that terrible knowledge. It's been with me for so long. That I could do things like that. I heard of an experiment once, one the Americans did. They had volunteers working a shock generator. The volunteers were told that it was wired to a patient in an adjoining room... it wasn't. There was only an actor, whose voice could be heard through the intercom. The volunteers were instructed by a doctor to start administering electric shocks. They were told to gradually increase the voltage. The "victim" began begging them to stop. They were told to increase it again. This time the victim started screaming. After a while the screams were choked off to be replaced by silence. The volunteers were told to increase the voltage once more... nearly 80% of those tested carried on administering shocks after the "victim" begged them to stop. Nearly 60% continued even after they believed that they'd killed him. They were ordinary people, and they were prepared to torture a stranger to death just because they were told to by someone in authority. Some of them said they'd even enjoyed it. I think I enjoyed what I did at the time. People are stupid and evil. There's something wrong with us... some hideous flaw.

From V For Vendatta<br>
Evey: There were riots, and people with guns. Nobody knew what was going on. Everyone was waiting for the government to do something...but there wasn't any government anymore. Just lots of little gangs. All trying to take over. And then in 1992, somebody finally did... it was all the fascist groups, the right-wingers. They'd all got together with some of the big corporations that had survived. 'Nosefire' they called themselves. I remember when they marched into London. They had a flag with their symbol on. Everyone was cheering. I thought they were scary. They soon got things under control. But then they started taking people away... all the black people and the Pakistanis... white people, too. All the radicals and the men who, you know, liked other men. The homosexuals. I don't know what they did with them all. Dad had been in a socialist group when he was younger. They came for him one September morning in 1993... it was my birthday, I was twelve. I never saw him again. They made me go and work in a factory with a lof of other kids. We were putting matches into boxes. I lived in  a hostel. It was cold and dirty and I just used to cry all the time. I wanted my dad. That's how it was for four years... not enough food, not enough money. Some of the older girls made money going with men. That's what I was going to do. Last night. But they were Fingermen. They were going... they were g-going to... they were going to ruh... ruh... ruh...<br>
V: Hush child, hush. It's over now. You're safe. The past can't hurt you anymore. Not unless you let it. They made you into a victim, Evey. They made you into a statistic. But that's not the real you. That's not who you are inside. Just trust me, Evey, and we can wipe it all away. All the pain. All the cruelty. All the bereavement. We can start again.

Dad: It's okay that you don't know your major. Truth is you can learn anything through Youtube. Youtube and practice. It's not that mysterious.<br>
Pablo: Easy for you to say. You have an engineering degree from Priceton.<br>
Dad: I didn't love engineering. I liked studying, but that was it. Tell me, do you love anything? Do you enjoy doing anything for the sake of doing it? Life isn't a destination. It's the continual practice of things that make you wiser and happier. Someday I hope to make perfect sourdough bread. I want to learn the piano. I've made peace with the fact that I won't ever make a lot of money, but I make enough to live and eat. The rest goes to your mother. I know you boys think the way I live is depressing or strange, but in art the purporse is in the creation, not the result. Grow as you build. Autotelism. 'Auto' for self and 'telo' for goal. Find joy in the learning, Pablo, not in what it will get you. It took me so much searching to stop searching. Art is fueled by longing but you must learn to want what you have, not get what you want. It's the only way to stop suffering. I pray that you'll know this meaning by the time you're my age.

Trevor: How do you prevent yourself from going stir crazy when you are stuck in that small environment for so long?<br>
Christina(astronaut): Definitely, I think it's all about how you frame it and your attitude. Just like now with what we're going through, for me, one of the tricks was to put the right thing on repeat in my head so if I found myself putting on repeat in my head "man, I sure wish I could just have a latte" or something ridiculous like that, I would replace it with what I have now that is unique and that I could never have again: "Wow, I'm really gonna be bummed out when I can't look at these auroras from space anymore.""

From The Matrix<br>
Morpheus: The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around. What do you see? Business men, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it. Were you listening to me Neo, or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?<br>
Morpheus: Sentient programs. They can move in and out of any software still hard wired to their system. That means that anyone we haven't unplugged is potentially an agent. Inside the Matrix, they are everyone and they are no one. We are survived by hiding from them, by running from them. But they are the gatekeepers. They are guarding all the doors. They are holding all the keys, which means that sooner or later, someone is going to have to fight them.<br>
Neo: Someone?<br>
Morpheus: I won't lie to you, Neo. Every single man or woman who has stood their ground, everyone who has fought an agent has died. But where they have failed, you will succeed.

It's dangerous, the mind has trouble letting go. I've seen it before and I'm sorry. I did what I did because...I had to. When the Matrix was first built, there was a man born inside who had the ability to change whatever he wanted, to remake the Matrix as he saw fit. It was he who freed the first of us, taught us the truth. As long as the Matrix exists the human race will never be free. After he died the Oracle prophesied his return and that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix and the war, bring freedom to our people. That is why there are those of us who have spent our entire lives searching the Matrix looking for him. I did what I did because I believe that search is over....

From The Matrix<br>
Neo: This...this isn't real?<br>
Morpheus: What is real? How do you define real? If you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. This is the world that you know. The world as it was at the end of the twentieth century. It exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation that we call the Matrix. You've been living in a dream world, Neo. This is the world as it exists today.... Welcome to the Desert of the Real. We have only bits and pieces of information but what we know for certain is that at some point in the early twenty-first century all of mankind was united in celebration. We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to AI.<br>
Neo: AI? You mean artificial intelligence?<br>
Morpheus: A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. We don't know who struck first, us or them. But we know that it was us that scorched the sky. At the time they were dependent on solar power and it was believed that they would be unable to survive without an energy source as abundant as the sun. Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate it seems is not without a sense of irony. The human body generates more bio-electricity than a 120-volt battery and over 25,000 BTU's of body heat. Combined with a form of fusion the machines have found all the energy they would ever need. There are fields, endless fields, where human beings are no longer born, we are grown. For the longest time I wouldn't believe it, and then I saw the fields with my own eyes. Watch them liquefy the dead so they could be fed intravenously to the living. And standing there, facing the pure horrifying precision, I came to realize the obviousness of the truth. What is the Matrix? Control. The Matrix is a computer generated dream world built to keep us under control in order to change a human being into this.<br>
Neo: No. I don't believe it. It's not possible.<br>

You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.<br>
Neo: What truth?<br>
Morpheus: That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage, born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your mind.... Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. This is your last chance. After this there is no turning back. You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.
